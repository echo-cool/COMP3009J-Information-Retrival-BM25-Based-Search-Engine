Friday, August 2, 2002 Part III Department of Defense Department of the Army, Corps of Engineers 33 CFR Part 385 Programmatic Regulations for the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan; Proposed Rule VerDate Jul
Proposed rule.
SUMMARY: The Army Corps of Engineers proposes to establish programmatic regulations for the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan.
Congress approved the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan in section 601 of the Water Resources Development Act of 2000, which was enacted into law on December 11, 2000.
The Act requires the Secretary of the Army to promulgate programmatic regulations within two years to ensure that the goals and purposes of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan are achieved.
We have developed these proposed regulations in response to that statutory requirement.
The proposed regulations establish processes and procedures that will guide the Army Corps of Engineers and its partners in the implementation of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan.

I. Background Section 601(h)(3) of the Water Resources Development Act of 2000, Public Law 106541 (114 Stat. 2688) (hereinafter ``WRDA 2000'') requires the Secretary of the Army, after notice and opportunity for public comment, to promulgate regulations to ensure that the goals and purposes of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (the Plan) are achieved.
These regulations implement this provision and establish the administrative structure for carrying out the Plan.
They establish a process: for the development of Project Implementation Reports, Project Cooperation Agreements, and Operating Manuals that will ensure that the goals and the objectives of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) are achieved; to ensure that new information resulting from changes or unforeseen circumstances, new scientific or technical information or information that is developed through the principles of adaptive management contained in the Plan, and future authorized changes to the Plan will be integrated into the implementation of the Plan; and to ensure the protection of the natural system consistent with the goals and purposes of the Plan, including the establishment of interim goals to provide a means by which the restoration success of the plan will be evaluated throughout the implementation process.
In general, the programmatic regulations envision that the goals and purposes of the Plan will be achieved through the development of projectspecific and system-wide measures.
Project specific measures include but are not limited to project implementation reports, project cooperation agreements, operating manuals, and design documentation reports.
The more generally applicable system-wide measures include, but are not limited to, the development of guidance memoranda, system-wide performance measures, the Master Implementation Sequencing Plan, interim goals, and targets for evaluating progress towards achieving other waterrelated needs of the region, including water supply and flood protection.
The interim goals and targets for other waterrelated needs are of special significance.
They establish incremental targets to evaluate progress toward the expected level of performance of the Plan and are used to monitor overall progress toward meeting the goals and purposes of the Plan.
Taken together, the project specific and system-wide measures form the foundation of the Plan and are critical to the successful restoration of the South Florida ecosystem.
The South Florida ecosystem is a nationally and internationally unique and important natural resource.
It is also a resource in peril, having been severely impacted by human activities for over a hundred years.
The Central and Southern Florida Project extends from south of Orlando to the Florida Keys and is composed of a regional network of canals, levees, water storage areas, and water control structures.
First authorized by Congress in 1948, the project serves multiple purposes.
The authorized purposes of the project include flood control, regional water supply for agricultural and urban areas, prevention of salt water intrusion, water supply to Everglades National Park, preservation of fish and wildlife, recreation, and navigation.
While fulfilling these authorized purposes, the project has had unintended adverse effects on the unique natural environment that constitutes the Everglades and South Florida ecosystem.
In 1996, the Army Corps of Engineers was directed to develop a comprehensive plan to restore and preserve south Florida's natural ecosystem, while enhancing water supplies and maintaining flood protection.
The resulting plan, which was submitted to Congress on July 1, 1999, is called the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan.
The overarching goal of the Plan is the restoration, preservation, and protection of the South Florida ecosystem while providing for other water-related needs of the region such as flood protection and water supply.
The Plan contains 68 major components that involve creation of approximately 217,000 acres of reservoirs and wetland-based water treatment areas, wastewater reuse plants, seepage management, and removal of levees and canals in natural areas.
These components vastly increase storage and water supply for the natural system, as well as for urban and agricultural needs, while maintaining existing Central and Southern Florida Project purposes.
The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan will restore more natural flows of water, including sheet flow; improve water quality; and establish more natural hydroperiods in the South Florida ecosystem.
Improvements to native flora and fauna, including those that benefit threatened and endangered species, are expected to occur as a result of the restoration of hydrologic conditions.
In enacting section 601 of WRDA 2000, Congress approved the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan as a framework for modifications to VerDate Jul
Section 601 of WRDA 2000 contains a variety of provisions associated with implementation of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan, including an authorization for the construction of four pilot projects and ten initial projects of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan.
Section 601(h) of WRDA 2000 states that ``the overarching objective of the Plan is the restoration, preservation, and protection of the South Florida ecosystem while providing for other water-related needs of the region, including water supply and flood protection.''
This subsection directs that the Plan be implemented to ensure the protection of water quality in, the reduction of the loss of fresh water from, and the improvement of the environment of the South Florida Ecosystem.
Implementation of the Plan also seeks to achieve and maintain the benefits to the natural system and human environment described in the Plan.
Section 601(h)(2) of WRDA 2000 requires the President and Governor to enter into a binding agreement ensuring that the water generated by the Plan will be made available to the natural system.
The President and Governor signed this agreement on January 9, 2002.
The agreement specifies that the State will ensure by regulation, or other appropriate means, that water made available by each project of the Plan will not be permitted for a consumptive use or otherwise made unavailable by the State until such time as sufficient reservations of water for restoration of the natural system are made under State law in accordance with the Project Implementation Report for that project and consistent with the Plan.
This agreement also specifies that the State will monitor and assess the continuing effectiveness of reservations as long as the project is authorized to achieve the goals and objectives of the Plan.
Section 601(h)(3) of WRDA 2000 requires that the Secretary of the Army, after notice and opportunity for public comment, and with the concurrence of the Governor of Florida and the Secretary of the Interior, and consultation with the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, the Seminole Tribe of Florida, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Secretary of Commerce, and other Federal, State, and local agencies, issue programmatic regulations within two years of the date of enactment of WRDA 2000 to ensure that the goals and purposes of the Plan are achieved.
The proposed regulations are a specific response to the requirements of this section.
Section 601(h)(4) of WRDA 2000 describes the project specific assurance requirements for Project Implementation Reports, Project Cooperation Agreements, and Operating Manuals.
Finally, section 601(h)(5) contains a Savings Clause that provides protection for existing legal sources of water that will be eliminated or transferred due to project implementation and provides for maintenance of the level of service for flood protection that is in existence on the date of enactment and in accordance with applicable law.
II.
Process for Developing the Proposed Regulations The Army developed the proposed regulations through an open and inclusive process that involved numerous meetings, briefings, and discussions with other Federal, State, and local agencies; the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida and the Seminole Tribe of Florida; agricultural, environmental, urban utilities, recreational, and urban interest groups; and the public.
Briefings on the programmatic regulations were provided to the Governing Board of the South Florida Water Management District and its Water Resources Advisory Commission and the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force and its Working Group.
In addition, programmatic regulations web pages were developed and posted on the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan web site (http:// www.evergladesplan.org).
The web site was used to disseminate information about the programmatic regulations and to provide a place for individuals and organizations to submit comments electronically during the development of the programmatic regulations.
This was designed to identify the major concerns of the agencies and various groups, prior to publishing the proposed regulations and soliciting formal public comment.
The Army held an opening round of meetings with agencies, interest groups, and the public in May and June 2001.
The purpose of these meetings was to discuss the process that would be used to develop the programmatic regulations and to solicit comments on the major issues and concerns that should be addressed in developing the regulations.
Following this initial round of meetings, we developed a draft outline of the programmatic regulations.
We then held a second round of meetings in September and October 2001 with agencies, interest groups, and the public to solicit comments on the draft outline.
50541 We also consulted with the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida and the Seminole Tribe of Florida, and sought their comments on the outline.
After the second round of meetings, we developed an initial draft of the programmatic regulations.
We distributed this initial draft to the public on December 28, 2001, and allowed for informal public comment until February 15, 2002.
We then held meetings with agencies, tribes, and interest groups, to discuss the initial draft.
We also received written comments on the initial draft that we posted on the programmatic regulations web site.
In addition, the Water Resources Advisory Commission formed a subcommittee on the programmatic regulations.
The subcommittee met several times to discuss issues concerning the initial draft and potential solutions to these issues.
The South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force also met several times after the release of the initial draft to discuss the programmatic regulations.
Finally, we developed the proposed regulations after considering all of the information received at the meetings, as well as written comments that were received from agencies, interest groups, and the public.
III.
Major Issues Addressed in Developing the Programmatic Regulations A. General As discussed, we held numerous meetings with agencies, tribes, interest groups, and the public.
The initial draft regulations released in December 2001 prompted a number of written comments by agencies, tribes, interest groups, and the public.
The major issues identified in those comments and how we considered the comments in developing the proposed rule are described in the following sections.
B. References to Senate Committee Report Language A number of comments concerned referring to the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Report (Senate Report No. 106Ã¯Â¿Â½ 362) in the preamble to the proposed regulations.
Some commenters believed that the Senate Report sets forth guidance for implementing the Plan and fulfilling the assurances provisions of section 601(h) of WRDA 2000.
Others expressed the opinion that Senate Committee Report 106362 carries no legislative weight since the bill discussed in Senate Committee Report 106362 differs in several critical areas from the final version of the bill adopted by the full United States Senate.
We have referred VerDate Jul
Our proposed definition also envisions using the principles of adaptive management to seek continuous improvement of the Plan based upon new information resulting from changed or unforeseen circumstances, new scientific or technical information, or information developed through the adaptive assessment principles contained in the Plan, or future authorized changes to the Plan that are integrated into the implementation of the Plan.
In adopting this definition, we recognize that the Plan envisions the recovery and maintenance of certain important ecological components and patterns that are thought to have characterized the natural system.
Achievement of these attributes is expected to result in the overall improvement of the environment of the South Florida ecosystem, including improvements to native flora and fauna, including threatened and endangered species; restoring the presence of key species in historic habitats; promoting a pattern of plant communities that form a gradient from aquatic communities to uplands; and providing habitat within the Everglades natural system to the species that inhabit the Everglades.
These improvements are accomplished generally by increasing water storage and water supply for the Everglades natural system; restoring more natural flows of water, including sheet flow; establishing more natural hydroperiods, including wet and dry season cycles, natural recession rates, surface water depth patterns, and, in coastal areas, salinity and mixing patterns; and protecting water quality for the Everglades natural system as described in the Plan.
It is important to understand that the ``restored'' Everglades of the future will be different from any version of the Everglades that has existed in the past.
While it will be significantly healthier than the current system, it will not completely match the pre-drainage system.
The irreversible physical changes made to the ecosystem make a complete match impossible.
The restored Everglades will be smaller and somewhat differently arranged than the historic ecosystem.
However, it will have recovered those essential hydrological and biological characteristics that defined the original Everglades and made it unique among the world's wetlands systems.
It will evoke the wildness and richness of the former Everglades.
D. Partnership With the State of Florida and With Others Implementation of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan will require an effective partnership between the Federal and State governments.
The State of Florida has established a trust fund, the Save Our Everglades Trust Fund, to pay for a significant portion of the non-Federal sponsor's share of implementation of the Plan and the South Florida Water Management District will serve as the non-Federal sponsor for implementing many of the projects of the Plan.
Section 601 of WRDA 2000 recognizes the importance of this constructive relationship and further encourages this partnership.
The proposed regulations promote the implementation of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan by defining the processes and procedures needed to accomplish the necessary planning, design, construction, and operation of the projects authorized pursuant to the Plan.
In addition, the proposed regulations establish a process of adaptive management where completed projects are monitored and assessed and changes to the Plan, its operations, or the schedule and sequence of projects are considered as appropriate to ensure that the goals and purposes of the Plan are achieved.
The processes and requirements included in the proposed regulations also were developed to take into account the interests of the South Florida Water Management District, the State of Florida, or other non-Federal sponsors as the Plan is implemented.
The proposed regulations also recognize that the non-Federal sponsor for some projects of the Plan will be governmental entities other than the South Florida Water Management District.
E. Consultation The implementation of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan is the responsibility of the Corps of Engineers and the non-Federal sponsor; however, successful implementation of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan requires not just the involvement of the implementing agencies, but also extensive involvement by other Federal, State, local agencies, and the Tribes.
The proposed regulations envision that the implementing agencies will consult with the Department of the Interior, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Commerce, the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, the Seminole Tribe of Florida, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, and other Federal, State, and to the Senate Report in the proposed regulations, like any other part of the history of the Plan, where we believe it may be helpful to understanding the statute or the issues involved in interpreting or implementing the statute.
C. Defining Restoration Many comments concerned the value of defining restoration in the regulation.
Some commenters expressed the view that a definition is needed in order to better define what is meant by the phrase ``restoration, preservation, and protection of the South Florida ecosystem'' used in section 601 of WRDA 2000.
Some commenters maintained that the Plan is only a framework and that Congress expected the implementing agencies to propose improvements to the Plan's goal of restoration through a regular process of adaptive management.
These commenters believed that a comprehensive definition of restoration, including environmental and ecological recovery of the natural system, is needed to guide the process.
While recognizing the theoretical merits of these views, other commenters felt that this concept of restoration was too open-ended.
These commenters believed that Congress adopted a specific framework for restoration in enacting WRDA 2000 and that framework was set forth in the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan.
They maintained that the restoration authorized by this Plan, while extensive, does not envision restoring the Everglades to its natural condition before the intervention of humans.
For the purposes of this regulation, we have adopted a middle ground between these two perspectives.
We have defined the term ``restoration'' to mean the level of recovery and protection described in the plan that was approved by Congress in enacting WRDA 2000 as a framework for hydrologic restoration, and any future Congressional amendments to that framework.
However, we have also highlighted in the definition that the Plan is designed to deliver water to and improve water quality in the natural system so that it once again exhibits and sustains essential physical and ecological characteristics that defined the pre-drainage South Florida ecosystem, including more natural hydropatterns, and that these hydrological modifications are a precursor to improvements to native flora and fauna, restoration of key habitats, and promotion of a pattern of VerDate Jul
The consultation provisions ensure that these interested parties are appropriately involved with the Corps of Engineers and the non-Federal sponsor in implementing, evaluating, and adapting the Plan.
The consultation provisions contemplate a timely exchange of views between parties.
In other words, consultation is not to be used as a de facto veto power.
Similar to the considerations for setting time limits for consulting under NEPA (40 CFR 1501.8), the regulations envision that the Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District may set reasonable limits on the amount of time for consultation, giving due consideration to the size of the proposed action, the degree to which relevant information is known or obtainable, the degree to which the action is controversial, the state of the art of analytical techniques, the number of persons affected, the consequences of delay, and other time limits imposed on the agency by law, regulations, or executive order.
F. Amount of Detail in the Proposed Regulations Many comments addressed the degree of detail in the regulations.
Some believed that the programmatic regulations should be very detailed, specific, and prescriptive.
Others believed that the programmatic regulations should be more general.
Some commenters also expressed concern that the Federal regulations not infringe on the sovereignty of the State of Florida or its right to allocate its water resources.
Others sought to ensure that the regulations safeguard the Federal interest and investment in restoration, preservation, and protection of the South Florida ecosystem, including Federal properties such as national parks and wildlife refuges.
The proposed regulations attempt to address these concerns and provide guidance in implementing the Plan.
We recognize that more detailed guidance memoranda will be needed to assist the implementation of the Plan.
We have determined that the guidance memoranda should not be included in the programmatic regulations because they will be very technical, and are intended to provide internal guidance to the implementing agencies, and also because they still are in development.
This decision is consistent with the view of some who felt that including the guidance memoranda in the regulations was incompatible with rule-making procedures because of the changing nature of the adaptive management process.
These commenters were concerned that if guidance memoranda were included in these regulations, every revision to them would require us to initiate a rulemaking process.
We expect that revisions may occur frequently for some of these procedures, particularly during the early stages of implementation of the Plan.
The programmatic regulations contemplate that the guidance memoranda be developed six months after the effective date of the final rule published in the Federal Register or December 31, 2003, whichever is sooner, with the concurrence of the Secretary of the Interior and the Governor.
Even though we are not including the guidance memoranda in the regulations, we believe that the public should have an opportunity to review and comment on them in view of its interest in these matters.
Accordingly, the programmatic regulations envision that we will provide a notice of availability of the guidance memoranda in the Federal Register and seek public comments before they are completed.
After they are completed, the Corps of Engineers will consider during the next review and revision of the programmatic regulations, whether or not a particular guidance memorandum that has been completed, is appropriate for inclusion in the regulations.
G. Restoration Coordination and Verification (RECOVER) Many comments focused on the role of RECOVER in implementing the Plan.
Some of the commenters expressed concerns about how best to integrate individual projects into the Plan to ensure that the goals and purposes of the Plan are achieved.
Others articulated concerns about the need to use the best scientific information available.
Finally, some urged that RECOVER also focus on achieving the other water-related needs provided for in the Plan such as water supply and flood protection, along with restoration benefits.
RECOVER is an interdisciplinary, interagency scientific and technical team that is described in the Plan.
The proposed regulations recognize that the Restoration Coordination and Verification (RECOVER) team already is in place and envision using RECOVER to ensure that a system-wide perspective is applied and that the best available scientific and technical information will be used during the implementation, evaluation, and adaptation of the Plan.
The Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District will oversee the activities of RECOVER.
The 50543 regulations also recognize the key role of the Department of the Interior in RECOVER because of its extensive experience in managing the Everglades National Park, and provide an important role for the Department in the Leadership Group of RECOVER, along with the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, the Seminole Tribe of Indians, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, and other Federal, State and local agencies as appropriate.
While RECOVER is not a policy making body, the regulations outline a series of specific scientific and technical responsibilities for RECOVER that will assist the implementing agencies (the Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District) in achieving the goals and purposes of the Plan, particularly restoration of the natural system.
RECOVER will be responsible for, among other things, developing systemwide performance measures for consideration by the Corps of Engineers and South Florida Water Management District, in evaluating projects in achieving the system-wide goals and purposes of the Plan, preparing Project Implementation Reports, developing and recommending proposals for a system-wide monitoring plan, conducting assessment activities for the adaptive management program, considering proposed revisions to the Plan, and developing recommendations for interim goals.
The proposed regulations memorialize many of the activities already underway by RECOVER.
The proposed regulations make it clear that RECOVER is a scientific and technical team.
Documents prepared by RECOVER are not self-executing and must be reviewed, discussed, revised, and/or approved by responsible management officials of the Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District, in consultation with the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, the Seminole Tribe of Indians, the U.S. Department of the Interior, the U.S. Department of Commerce, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, and other Federal, State and local agencies as appropriate prior to implementation of management responses based on the results and findings contained therein.
H. Independent Scientific Review Some commenters emphasized the need to maintain the system-wide focus of the Plan during implementation and felt that a mechanism must be developed to ensure that the best and VerDate Jul
most current scientific information be used throughout implementation.
Other commenters also expressed the view that an independent entity should be responsible for reviewing the science used to support the implementation of the Plan.
The regulations recognize that, as required by Section 601(j) of WRDA 2000, an independent scientific review panel should be established.
The proposed regulations do not establish this panel, but provide for its establishment.
The regulations include provisions for cooperating with the panel, considering the panel's advice, and responding to the panel's recommendations.
I. Project Implementation Reports Section 601 of WRDA 2000 establishes a new type of reporting document called a Project Implementation Report to bridge the gap between the conceptual level of detail in the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan and the detail needed for project design.
Section 601(h)(4)(A) of WRDA 2000 specifies a number of items required to be in a Project Implementation Report, including identification of the appropriate quantity, timing, and distribution of water dedicated and managed for the natural system, and the identification of the amount of water to be reserved or allocated for the natural system.
Some comments focused on the need to create a clearly defined process for the development of Project Implementation Reports, and, in particular, the formulation and evaluation of individual projects of the Plan.
The report of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works on the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 (Senate Report No. 106362) defines Project Implementation Reports as follows: The project implementation report is a new type of reporting document, similar to a General Reevaluation Report in that it will contain additional project formulation and evaluation.
The project implementation report also will contain General Design Memorandum level of detail, or higher, for engineering and design.
Some of the tasks associated with the preparation of the project implementation report will include: surveys and mapping; geotechnical analyses; flood damage assessment; real estate analyses; and preparation of supplemental National Environmental Policy Act documents.
The project implementation reports will bridge the gap between the programmatic-level design contained in the Plan and the detailed design necessary to proceed to construction.
Furthermore, each project implementation report will be accompanied by a Project Management Plan, which will detail schedules, funding requirements, and The proposed regulations provide guidance for the development of Project Implementation Reports.
They describe the requirements of a Project Implementation Report, including providing information required by the State of Florida for the participation of the non-Federal sponsor in the implementation of various components of the Plan.
These requirements are set forth in Florida Statutes sections 373.1501 and 373.470, which specify the information that must be available before State agencies can participate in implementation of CERP projects.
The proposed regulations contemplate that the Project Implementation Report will contain performance evaluations of alternatives in achieving the systemwide goals and purposes of the Plan, interim goals, and targets for progress toward other water-related needs.
The Project Implementation Report also will include evaluations designed to ensure, to the extent practicable and consistent with the system-wide goals and purposes of the Plan, that the project delivers benefits, including benefits to the natural system, that would justify the project, in the context of the then existing Central and Southern Florida Project as modified by any CERP components that have already been implemented.
The regulations also envision the development of a guidance memorandum that describes the major tasks necessary to develop a Project Implementation Report and an outline for the content of the Project Implementation Report.
Finally, the regulations provide for development of a guidance memorandum establishing procedures for the formulation and evaluation of projects.
J. Project Cooperation Agreements The Project Cooperation Agreement is the legal agreement between the Department of the Army and the nonFederal sponsor that must be executed before a project can be constructed.
Section 601(h) of WRDA 2000 requires that the Secretary not execute a Project Cooperation Agreement until the State has reserved or allocated water for the natural system under State law as described in the Project Implementation Report.
Some commenters questioned how the reservation or allocation would be made in accordance with the Project Implementation Report and how the Project Cooperation Agreement would verify this allocation of reservation had, in fact, been made.
These commenters recommended that a guidance memorandum be developed to outline how the verification would occur.
Others commenters were concerned that the Federal government not infringe on the State's authority under state law to make and revise reservations as necessary.
We agree that a guidance memorandum should be developed that outlines how Project Implementation Reports will identify how the appropriate quantity, timing and distribution of water dedicated and managed for the natural system will be determined, and how they will identify the amount of water that is to be reserved or allocated for the natural system in accordance with the provisions of WRDA 2000.
The proposed regulations state that the Project Cooperation Agreement must include a finding that the reservation or allocation has been made by the State as required by Section 601(h) of WRDA 2000.
This will provide the assurances regarding the reservation and Project Implementation Report that Congress intended without infringing on the State's right to reserve or allocate water under State law.
In addition, the regulations further specify that the Project Cooperation Agreement (PCA) include a provision that any change to the reservation or allocation of water for the natural system made under State law shall require an amendment to the PCA.
Further, the Secretary shall verify, in consultation with the South Florida Water Management District, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Commerce, the Seminole Tribe of Florida, the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, and other Federal, State, and local agencies that the revised reservation or allocation continues to provide for an appropriate quantity, timing and distribution of water dedicated and managed for the natural system after considering any changed circumstances or information since completion of the Project Implementation Report.
Finally, the proposed regulations recognize that the Project Cooperation Agreement must include several provisions required by the savings clause of Section 601(h)(5) of WRDA 2000.
Accordingly, the Project Cooperation Agreement includes a provision that prohibits the Corps of Engineers and the non-Federal sponsor from eliminating or transferring existing legal sources of water until a new source of comparable quantity and quality is available as that available on the date of enactment of WRDA 2000.
Similarly, in satisfaction of the savings clause requirements, the regulations specify VerDate Jul
K. Operating Manuals Operating Manuals provide guidance on how projects are to be operated to ensure that the goals and purposes of the Plan are achieved.
To achieve the goals and purposes of the Plan, individual projects must be operated as part of a system.
Some commenters sought to ensure that Operating Manuals prepared for individual projects take into account the system-wide purposes of the Plan.
Accordingly, the proposed regulations envision the development of two kinds of Operating Manuals.
In addition to Project Operating Manuals, a System Operating Manual will be developed to provide a system-wide plan for operating projects and other C
The regulations view Project Operating Manuals as supplements to the System Operating Manual, presenting aspects of the project not common to the system.
The proposed regulations contemplate that a Project Operating Manual will be developed for each project.
A draft Project Operating Manual will be included as an appendix in the Project Implementation Report.
This will connect the operation of the project to the expected benefits of the project recommended in the Project Implementation Report.
The final Project Operating Manual is to be prepared as soon as possible after completion of the operational testing and monitoring phase of the project.
L. Sequencing and Scheduling of Projects The Plan consists of 68 components that will be implemented as approximately 45 separate projects, including pilot projects.
The ``Final Integrated Feasibility Report and Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement'' dated April 1, 1999, included a sequence and schedule for implementation of the Plan.
In July 2001, the Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District updated the sequence and schedule to incorporate updated information and requirements from Congress and the Florida legislature.
The sequence and schedule of projects was the subject of many comments.
Some commenters sought to ensure that the sequencing and schedule of projects would produce restoration benefits early in the implementation process.
Others were apprehensive of this early focus on restoration benefits and were concerned that other water-related needs of the region as provided for in the Plan would be postponed until late in the implementation process.
The proposed regulations establish a process for developing a Master Implementation Sequencing Plan and specify that projects will be sequenced and scheduled to maximize the achievement of the goals and purposes of the Plan, including the achievement of the interim goals at the earliest possible time, to the extent practical given scientific, technical, funding, contracting, and other constraints.
The Master Implementation Sequencing Plan will also provide for sequencing and scheduling of projects to ensure, to the extent practicable and consistent with the system-wide goals of the Plan, that each project delivers benefits, including benefits to the natural system, that would justify the project, in the context of the then existing Central and Southern Florida Project as modified by any CERP components that have already been implemented.
The Master Implementation Sequencing Plan will base the sequence and schedule of projects on the best scientific, technical, funding, contracting, and other information available.
The proposed regulations also envision that the Master Implementation Sequencing Plan will be revised as necessary to integrate new information such as updated schedules from Project Management Plans, the results of pilot projects and other studies, updated funding information, revisions to the Plan, Congressional or other authorization and direction, or information from the adaptive management program, including achievement of the expected performance level of the Plan and the interim goals.
M. Adaptive Management Program One of the key components of the Plan is adaptive management.
Adaptive management provides the opportunity to improve the design and performance of the Plan based on new information.
The report of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works on WRDA 2000 (Senate Report No. 106 362) describes the intent of the adaptive management program: The committee does not expect rigid adherence to the Plan as it was submitted to Congress.
This result would be inconsistent with the adaptive management principles in the Plan.
Restoration of the Everglades is the goal, not adherence to the modeling on which the April, 1999 Plan was based.
50545 Instead, the committee expects that the agencies responsible for project implementation report formulation and Plan implementation will seek continuous improvement of the Plan based upon new information, improved modeling, new technology and changed circumstances.
The regulations define adaptive management as the process of improving the understanding of the natural and human systems in the South Florida ecosystem, specifically as these understandings pertain to the goals and purposes of the Plan, and to ensure continuous improvement of the Plan reflective of new information resulting from changed or unforeseen circumstances, new scientific or technical information, or information developed through the adaptive assessment principles contained in the Plan, or future authorized changes to the Plan.
The opportunity for performance improvement offered by the adaptive management program is crucial for dealing with the uncertainties of the ecological responses that will occur as the Plan is implemented.
The proposed regulations establish an adaptive management program to guide implementation of the Plan and recognize the importance of assessment reports to this process.
The proposed regulations specify that the implementing agencies will use assessment reports to seek continuous improvement in the Plan.
The proposed regulations provide that in considering how the Plan may be improved, the Corps of Engineers and non-Federal project sponsor specifically consider modifying the design or operational plan for a project of the Plan not yet implemented; modifying the sequence or schedule for implementation of the Plan; adding new components to the Plan or deleting components not yet implemented; removing or modifying a component of the Plan already in place; or a combination of any of these actions.
RECOVER will be responsible for carrying out these assessment tasks and submitting them to the Corps and the South Florida Water Management District for review.
N. Revisions to the Plan We anticipate that the Plan will need to be revised periodically as part of the adaptive management program to reflect new information and to improve performance.
The proposed regulations provide that a Comprehensive Plan Modification Report be prepared whenever significant revisions to the Plan are necessary to ensure that the goals and purposes of the Plan are achieved.
The Comprehensive Plan Modification Report will be prepared VerDate Jul
Therefore, the regulations do not contemplate that water will be strictly allocated on an 80%20% basis, either system-wide or on a project-byproject basis.
Many commenters questioned how water would be reserved or allocated for the natural system.
These questions focused on how the statutorily-required identification of water reservations and allocations for the natural system in each Project Implementation Report, would be coordinated with the actual reservation or allocation process which is conducted under State law.
Developing the pre-CERP baseline is of central importance to ensuring attainment of the benefits of the Plan and to resolving this issue.
This baseline represents the conditions in the region on the date of enactment of WRDA 2000 accounting for natural variations and including existing legal sources of water.
The baseline will establish the amount of water that is presently delivered by the Central and Southern Florida Project.
The proposed regulations provide that the pre-CERP baseline will be established by June 30, 2003.
The proposed regulations also provide that each Project Implementation Report will consider the change of pre-CERP baseline water availability in identifying the quantity, timing, and distribution of water to be made available for the natural system by a project component; whether improvements in water quality are needed in order to ensure that water delivered to the natural system meets applicable water quality standards; whether additional quantity, timing, and distribution of water and/or improved water quality should be made available by subsequent projects; whether to recommend preparation of a Comprehensive Plan Modification Report; and whether to recommend that the State of Florida and its agencies reexamine the reservation or allocation of water needed under State law in order to meet the needs of the natural system and such uses identified under the savings clause.
The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan was developed as an integrated set of components or projects that are intended to work together to successfully achieve the goals and purposes of the Plan.
Although individual projects increase the amount of water available, the effect of an individual project extends far beyond the location of the project.
Accordingly, it is important that the identification of water to be reserved for the natural system take into account the synergistic and regional effect of projects.
The proposed regulations contemplate that a guidance memorandum will be developed to provide uniform guidance for quantifying water made available by projects and for identifying the water to be reserved for the natural system.
The proposed regulations also provide direction for the development of the guidance memorandum.
Some agencies, interest groups, and the public were concerned about potential variations from the predicted availability of water once projects actually are implemented and operated.
The proposed regulations provide that development of a Comprehensive Plan Modification Report be undertaken to determine the need for revisions to the Plan.
The regulations also provide that in the interim during preparation of the Comprehensive Plan Modification Report, operation of the project should be consistent with the procedures identified in the Project Implementation Report and Project Operating Manual.
P. Savings Clause Provisions Many commenters questioned the effects of implementation of the Plan on existing legal sources of water and on existing levels of flood protection.
As discussed, Section 601(h)(5)(A) of WRDA 2000 contains a savings clause provision that is designed to ensure that existing sources of water and levels of flood protection are preserved.
The report of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works on WRDA 2000 (Senate Report No. 106 362) describes the intent of this savings clause as follows: Elimination of existing sources of water supply is barred until new sources of comparable quantity and quality of water are available; existing authorized levels of flood protection are maintained; and the water compact among the Seminole Tribe of Florida, the State, and the South Florida Water Management District is specifically preserved.
With respect to flood control, the committee intends that implementation of the Plan will not result in significant adverse impact to any person with an existing, legally recognized right to a level of protection against flooding.
The committee does not intend that, consistent with benefits included in the Plan, this bill create any new rights to a level of protection against flooding that is not currently recognized under applicable Federal or State law.
using a process consistent with the processes used to develop a Project Implementation Report.
The proposed regulations provide that the final approved Comprehensive Plan Modification Report will be transmitted to Congress.
O. Ensuring Achievement of Plan Benefits The Plan will improve the quantity, quality, timing, and distribution of water to the South Florida ecosystem.
Section 601(f) of WRDA 2000 specifies that the Secretary in coordination with the non-Federal sponsor prepare Project Implementation Reports prior to implementation of those projects.
Section 601(h)(4)(A) of WRDA 2000 specifies a number of items required to be in a Project Implementation Report, including identification of the appropriate quantity, timing, and distribution of water dedicated and managed for the natural system, and the identification of the amount of water to be reserved or allocated for the natural system.
The reservation or allocation of water for the natural system will be implemented under State law and must be made before the Army can execute a Project Cooperation Agreement for the project.
``State law'' includes reservations or allocations of water made by Florida's Water Management Districts under authority of State law.
A number of commenters expressed the view that the Plan required that water be reserved for the natural system on an 80%20% basis.
These commenters rely on the report of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works on WRDA 2000 (Senate Report No. 106362) that states: The Plan contains a general outline of the quantities of water to be produced by each project.
According to the Army Corps, 80 percent of the water generated by the Plan is needed for the natural system in order to attain restoration goals, and 20 percent of the water generated for use in the human environment.
* * * Subject to future authorizations by Congress, the committee fully expects that the water necessary for restoration, currently estimated at 80 percent of the water generated by the Plan, will be reserved or allocated for the benefit of the natural system (Emphasis added).
Although those percentages were appropriate as an initial estimate for the purpose of evaluating the Plan, the regulations anticipate that each Project Implementation Report will evaluate and identify water to be reserved for the natural system and made available for other water-related needs of the region, and that the Plan itself will be continually evaluated through adaptive management.
Accordingly, the water Although the savings clause uses the term ``existing legal sources of water,'' it does not define the term.
Nor could we find a definition elsewhere in Federal or State law.
We have not defined the term in the proposed regulations, leaving the definition of an ``existing legal source'' VerDate Jul
We may include a definition after considering submitted comments.
Currently, the proposed regulations specify that the Project Implementation Report will include an analysis to determine if the project will cause an elimination or transfer of existing legal sources of water.
If the project will cause an elimination or transfer of a source of water, then the Project Implementation report will include measures to ensure that such elimination or transfer will not take place until a new source of water of comparable quantity or quality is available to replace the water that would be lost as a result of implementation of the Plan.
Existing legal sources of water may include water currently available for agriculture, water supply, tribal use, or elements of the natural system including the Everglades, as well as any other existing legal sources.
The proposed regulations require a Project Implementation Report to include an analysis of the level of service for flood protection that was in existence on the date of enactment of the statute; and is in accordance with applicable law.
If this analysis shows that the level of service for flood protection would be reduced by implementation of a project, then the regulations state that the project or its implementation plan will be modified to mitigate or eliminate the adverse effect on flood protection.
Some commenters raised the question of how the Plan would address opportunities for increased levels of flood protection or the provision of flood protection in locations where there currently is no flood protection.
The overarching objective of the Plan is the restoration, preservation, and protection of the South Florida ecosystem while providing for other water-related needs of the region, including water supply and flood protection.
Accordingly, the proposed regulations allow for the evaluation of increased levels of flood protection or the provision of flood protection in areas where there is currently no flood protection, provided that such flood protection is consistent with the goals and purposes of the Plan and is in accordance with the provisions of section 601(f)(2)(B) of WRDA 2000 and other applicable laws.
Q. Interim Goals Many comments focused on development of the interim goals.
Section 601(h)(3)(c)(i)(III) of WRDA 2000 requires that interim goals be established to provide a means by which the restoration success of the Plan may be evaluated throughout the restoration process.
Progress towards meeting the interim goals is to be reported to Congress as part of the periodic reports required by the Act.
While there was widespread agreement among agencies, tribes, interest groups, and the public that interim goals should be established to ensure that the goals and purposes of the Plan are achieved, there were different views about whether these interim goals should be a part of the programmatic regulations.
Some believed that the interim goals needed to be a part of the programmatic regulations to ensure that the goals would be met.
They also believed that goals had to be incorporated into the regulations to enable the public to take part in the process of establishing the goals.
Others were concerned that the statute specifically required the regulations to set up the process for establishing interim goals rather than the goals themselves.
Additional commenters were concerned that placing the interim goals in the programmatic regulations would make goals difficult to adopt and amend, and that the adaptive management process authorized by section 601 of WRDA 2000 was incompatible with the Administrative Procedures Act rulemaking process.
Other commenters were concerned that incorporating the goals into the regulations would suggest that the goals were meant to set standards or schedules enforceable in court rather than planning targets, and assessment and reporting tools.
In addition, during development of the proposed regulations, it was apparent that there was not complete agreement on exactly what the interim goals should be.
Staff of the implementing agencies required additional time to model the implementation schedule to evaluate expected performance at specific points in the implementation process.
This modeling is an important first step in developing incremental stages (interim goals) for achieving that performance.
Moreover, the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force and others indicated an interest in reviewing and discussing interim goals before they were adopted.
Thus, even among those who thought that interim goals should be included in these regulations, it was clear that more time for modeling was needed.
The proposed regulations recognize these facts and attempt to accommodate the views of commenters by establishing the principles that will guide the development of the interim goals and 50547 appropriately involve the public.
The proposed regulations establish the structure for developing and adopting the interim goals, and make it clear that interim goals are targets for use of the agencies and Congress in evaluating the success of the restoration effort.
They are not intended to be standards or schedules enforceable in court.
The Restoration Coordination and Verification (RECOVER) team will use the principles set forth in the proposed regulations to develop and recommend a set of interim goals for implementation of the Plan no later than June 30, 2003.
The regulations specify that interim goals shall reflect the incremental accomplishment of the expected performance level of the Plan, and will identify improvements in quantity, timing and distribution of water in fiveyear increments beginning in 2005.
The interim goals will also include indicators for water quality improvement and ecological responses, such as increases in extent of wetlands, improvements in habitat quality, and improvements in native plant and animal abundance.
However, the regulations also recognize that achievement of improvements in water quality and desired ecological responses may be dependent on other programs and activities outside the scope of CERP.
The extent of this dependence on outside programs and activities should be explicitly assessed and described at the time goals are developed, and should be taken into account as the CERP is subsequently evaluated relative to the goals.
The interim goals shall be predicted by appropriate models and tools and shall provide a quantitative basis for evaluating the restoration success of the Plan during the period of implementation.
The expected level of the Plan is generally represented by the output of the model run of D13R as described in the ``Final Integrated Feasibility Report and Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement'' dated April 1, 1999, as modified by section 601 of WRDA 2000, or any subsequent modification authorized in law.
The proposed regulations envision that RECOVER will provide its recommendations to the Corps of Engineers and South Florida Water Management District for review and discussion.
Interim goals will be memorialized in an agreement to be signed by the Department of the Army, the Department of the Interior, and the State no later than December 31, 2003.
The Department of the Army, the Department of the Interior, and the State will provide a notice of availability of the proposed agreement to the public in the Federal Register, seek public VerDate Jul
The regulations recognize that the concept of restoration anticipates future improvements to the Plan through adaptive management.
The regulations also recognize that performance measures will continue to be refined and developed throughout the course of implementing the Plan.
Interim goals will show incremental progress towards reaching the expected performance level of the Plan at different time intervals during implementation.
The regulations envision that the RECOVER team will provide their recommendations about interim goals to the Corps of Engineers and South Florida Water Management District.
These recommendations will be considered during the development of an agreement on interim goals that is to be finalized by the Army, the Department of the Interior, and the State of Florida by December 31, 2003.
These interim goals will be used initially to evaluate the success of the restoration effort and will be refined periodically during the implementation of the Plan as appropriate to ensure that the overall restoration objectives of the Plan are achieved.
S. Targets for Other Water-Related Needs of the Region The overarching objective of the Plan is the restoration, preservation, and protection of the South Florida ecosystem while providing for other water-related needs of the region, including water supply and flood protection.
Some commenters urged that, in addition to the interim goals aimed at evaluating restoration success of the Plan, the regulations also should provide incremental targets for the other water-related needs of the region.
They believe that this will ensure that all of the goals and purposes of the Plan are achieved.
Others commented that, if these other incremental targets were included, progress towards achieving these targets should be evaluated separately from interim goals.
Identifying incremental targets for the other water-related needs of the region will help evaluate the success of implementation of the Plan in achieving the non-restoration goals of the Plan.
Therefore, we have decided to establish in the regulations a mechanism for evaluating progress towards providing for these other water-related needs.
The regulations provide that by June 30, 2003, RECOVER will develop recommendations on targets to evaluate progress on achieving the other waterrelated needs of the region, for consideration by the Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District, in consultation with others.
The Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District will also consult with the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force in establishing targets for evaluating progress towards achieving other water-related needs of the region provided for in the Plan.
These targets shall be established by the Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District by December 31, 2003.
These targets are intended to facilitate inter-agency planning, monitoring, and assessment throughout the implementation process and are not intended to be standards or schedules enforceable in court.
Interim goals, which are directed at restoration success of the Plan, and targets for achieving the other waterrelated needs of the region, which are not directed at restoration, are set out in two distinct sections to make clear that they are intended to evaluate two different types of goals of the Plan.
In recognition of the significant technical and scientific analyses that are needed in the development of interim goals and targets, RECOVER has already begun the work necessary in order to meet the June 30, 2003 deadline for providing recommendations on interim goals and targets for other water-related needs to the Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District.
T. Role of the Department of the Interior Several commenters urged that the Department of the Interior play a significant role in implementation of the Plan because of its stewardship role over Federal lands and natural resources involved in the Plan.
The regulations give the Department of the Interior a special concurring role, along with the Governor of the State of Florida, in the development of six specific guidance memoranda related to important program-wide aspects of implementing the Plan: (1) General format and content of Project Implementation Reports; (2) processes for Project Delivery Team evaluation of alternatives developed for Project Implementation Reports, their cost effectiveness and impacts; (3) process for system-wide evaluation of PIR alternatives by RECOVER; (4) the general content of operating manuals; (5) general processes for the conduct of assessment activities of RECOVER; and comments, and consult with Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, the Seminole Tribe of Florida, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Commerce, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, and other Federal, State, and local agencies and the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force concerning the proposed interim goals.
Finally, the proposed regulations establish a process for revising the interim goals in five-year increments or sooner, if appropriate in light of new information.
Finally, some commenters believed that the interim goals should take into account other water-related needs of the region, including water supply and flood protection, as provided for in the Plan.
Other commenters believed that the interim goals should not evaluate other water-related needs of the region.
We felt that the interim goals should focus solely on restoration success because section 601(h)(3)(c)(i)(III) of WRDA 2000 specifies that the interim goals are to provide a means by which restoration success may be evaluated throughout the implementation process.
The proposed regulations reflect this view.
However, the statute recognizes that providing for other water-related needs of the region, including water supply and flood protection, are also objectives of the Plan.
Therefore, the proposed regulations also provide for separately monitoring progress on other water-related needs of the region as provided for in the Plan during the implementation process, thus ensuring that all of the goals and purposes of the Plan will be achieved.
R. Relationship Among Restoration, Performance Measures, and Interim Goals In order to comprehend how the Plan will be evaluated to ensure that its restoration objectives are achieved, it is essential to understand the relationship among the concepts of restoration, performance measures, and interim goals.
In this regulation, restoration is defined as the level of recovery and protection to the South Florida ecosystem described in the Plan approved by Congress, with such modifications that Congress may provide for in the future.
As the regulations indicate, the concept of restoration in the Plan approved by Congress was expressed in a level of recovery assessed in terms of performance measures, consisting chiefly of hydrologic characteristics.
The definition also recognizes that increased flows to the natural system are expected to restore essential VerDate Jul
The regulations also give the Secretary of the Interior and the Governor of the State of Florida a concurring role in the Secretary of the Army's determination of the pre-CERP baseline.
They also specify that interim goals will be established through a formal Interim Goals Agreement between the Corps of Engineers, the State, and the Department of the Interior.
Further, the Department of the Interior is provided an important role in the Leadership Group of RECOVER, along with several other Federal and State agencies and the two Tribes.
Finally, the regulations give the Department of the Interior an important consulting role throughout implementation of the program, including, among other things, participation on Project Development Teams; development of the Adaptive Management Program; selection and revision of hydrologic models; development of Project Management Plans and Program Management Plans; development of Project Implementation Reports; development of Operating Manuals; development, review and revision of changes to the Master Implementation Sequencing Schedule; recommending and developing Comprehensive Plan Modification Reports; and developing means for monitoring progress towards other water-related needs of the region as provided for in the Plan.
U.
Role of South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force Several commenters suggested that the Programmatic Regulations create a specific role for the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force, an interagency group created by section 528(f) of the Water Resources Development Act of 1996 (110 Stat. 3770) (hereinafter ``WRDA 96'').
The legal basis for the Task Force's role in the restoration effort is found both in Section 528 of WRDA 96 and in Section 601 of WRDA 2000.
Section 528 envisions that the Task Force will coordinate programs and research on ecosystem restoration, exchange information, provide assistance and facilitate resolution of conflicts involving South Florida ecosystem restoration.
In Section 601(j) of WRDA 2000, the Task Force is also given a consultation responsibility concerning the establishment of an independent scientific review panel to review the progress that is being made toward achieving the natural system restoration goals of the Plan.
Some members of the Task Force and its associated working group represent agencies involved in implementing CERP under the programmatic regulations, such as the Jacksonville District Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District.
As recognized by this regulation, the South Florida Water Management District and the Jacksonville District already regularly report to the Task Force and its working group on CERP matters.
The Task Force also has appointed the Water Resources Advisory Commission (WRAC) of the South Florida Water Management District as an advisory body to the Task Force.
The Corps of Engineers serves on this body and regularly briefs that body on CERP.
The Department of the Army recognizes the important role that these collaborative groups play in discussion and resolution of CERP issues.
We expect that informal coordination among the implementing agencies, the Task Force and its working group and its other advisory bodies will continue.
For example, the Task Force may wish to have regular briefings on CERP implementation issues, on the Master Implementation Sequencing Plan, on Project Implementation Reports, or on Operating Manuals; or the Task Force may decide to have RECOVER provide the working group with information on work in progress.
Further, we contemplate that the Task Force will determine, on a case-by-case basis, the manner and extent to which it is appropriate for it to be involved in CERP in order to carry out its existing statutory responsibilities.
If a regular process evolves, it can be incorporated into revisions of the Programmatic Regulations.
At recent meetings, the Task Force expressed an interest in consultation on several subjects.
Accordingly, this draft regulation incorporates consultation with the Task Force on those subjects.
They include: interim goals; targets for other water-related needs of the region as provided for in the Plan; certain assessment reports; Comprehensive Plan Modification Reports; Pilot Project Technical Data Reports; and periodic reports to Congress by the Secretary of Army and Secretary of Interior in consultation with EPA, Department of Commerce, and the State of Florida.
The final regulation may provide for additional subjects upon which the Task Force may consult, if deemed appropriate after consideration of public comments.
V. NEPA Compliance As required by regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality (40 50549 CFR 1505.1 and 1507.3), agencies must issue regulations identifying classes of actions generally requiring an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), generally not subject to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), and actions requiring an Environmental Assessment (EA) of whether a full NEPA EIS is required or not.
The Corps of Engineers has adopted procedures generally implementing NEPA in Ã¯Â¿Â½ 230 of this chapter.
The Programmatic Regulations consider on a system-wide basis, the kinds of actions needed to implement the Plan, and apply the principles of Ã¯Â¿Â½ 230 to those activities.
The programmatic regulations identify certain actions which generally require preparation of a NEPA document (either an Environmental Impact Statement or an environmental assessment), or which are categorically excluded from NEPA.
Actions, such as the development or revision of methods or guidance memoranda, are listed as categorically excluded.
Although the development or revision of a method or guidance memorandum itself would not require a NEPA analysis, use of the method or guidance memorandum would be analyzed under NEPA, as appropriate, in a decision document such as a Project Implementation Report.
In general, the NEPA documentation for a particular project will be included in the Project Implementation Report.
For this reason, other project-specific documents such as the Design Documentation Report, Project Cooperation Agreement, Project Management Plan, and detailed plans and specifications for the project are listed as categorically excluded from NEPA documentation requirements.
The Corps recognizes that these documents may address elements of the project that have a potential to significantly affect the quality of the human environment, and fully intends that these effects should be analyzed and considered as required by NEPA, but believes that this analysis and consideration can be most effectively accomplished by including one comprehensive NEPA analysis for each project in the Project Implementation Report, rather than having piecemeal analyses in each of the supporting documents.
Some commenters expressed the view that the guidance memorandum for determining the quantity, timing and distribution of water dedicated and managed for the natural system in a Project Implementation Report (PIR) should be analyzed in an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS).
Since the guidance memorandum is procedural and does not affect the environment, recommend legislation, or determine a VerDate Jul
V. Concurrence Requirements for This Regulation The Secretary of the Interior and the Governor are required by Section 601(h)(3)(B) of WRDA 2000 to provide the Secretary with a written statement of concurrence or non-concurrence on the proposed programmatic regulations within 180 days from the end of the public comment period.
This statute specifies that a failure to provide a written statement of concurrence or nonconcurrence within the 180-day time frame will be deemed as meeting the concurrency requirements.
A copy of any concurrency or nonconcurrency statement shall be made a part of the administrative record and be referred to in the final programmatic regulations.
Any nonconcurrency statements shall specifically detail the reason or reasons for the nonconcurrence.
Throughout the process of developing the proposed regulations, we have maintained close coordination with the Department of the Interior and the State of Florida.
The Army will give good faith consideration to the concurrence or non-concurrence statements of the Secretary of Interior and the Governor.
The final regulations will include a reference to these statements before making a decision to issue final regulations.
VI. Organization of the Proposed Rule We have organized the proposed regulations under five major headings.
The first heading, General Provisions, provides the purpose of the regulations, the applicability of the rule, definitions pertaining to the regulations and other general information.
The second heading, Program Goals and Responsibilities, describes the goals and purposes of the Plan; implementation principles; and implementation responsibilities, consultation, and coordination.
The remaining headings were designed to be consistent with the content required by section 601(h)(3)(C).
These headings are: Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan Implementation Processes; Incorporating New Information into the Plan; and Ensuring Protection of the Natural System and Water Availability Consistent with the Goals and Purposes of the Plan.
VII.
Public Comments Solicited We are soliciting comments and suggestions from the public, governmental organizations, and other interested parties on the proposed regulations.
If you wish to comment on this proposed rule, you may submit your comments and materials by any one of several methods (see ADDRESSES section).
If submitting comments by electronic format, please submit them in ASCII file format or Word file format and avoid the use of special characters and any form of encryption.
Please include your name and return e-mail address in your e-mail message.
Please note that your e-mail address will not be retained at the termination of the public comment period.
VIII.
Administrative Requirements A. Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.)
These regulations do not impose any information collection requirements for which OMB approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act is required.
Thus, this action is not subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act.
B. Executive Order 12866, as Amended Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), as amended, we must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements of the Executive Order.
The Executive Order defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or Tribal governments or communities; (2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order.
Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, as amended, it has been determined that these regulations are a ``significant regulatory action'' in light of the provisions of paragraph (4) above.
As such, this action was submitted to OMB for review.
Changes made in response to OMB suggestions or recommendations are documented in the public record.
specific quantity, timing, or distribution of water for a specific component, it was not considered to be a ``major Federal action'' under NEPA.
It is important to note that NEPA would apply to the decision made in a PIR for a specific project applying a guidance memorandum to that project and determining that a certain quantity, timing or distribution of water was required for the project.
Similar comments were directed at the interim goals.
Some commenters felt that the interim goals were not ``major Federal actions'' affecting the environment under NEPA.
These commenters regarded the interim goals as evaluation and reporting tools.
Other commenters maintained that the interim goals are planning goals and that as such should be subject to a full NEPA analysis.
In proposing these regulations, we determined that it was not appropriate at this time to make a programmatic decision on precisely how NEPA applied to interim goals because the interim goals have not yet been established and since the extent to which interim goals will be used in planning is still under consideration.
When specific interim goals are proposed for adoption, a decision can be made on exactly how NEPA applies.
Moreover, when the Programmatic Regulations are revised for the first time, the Corps will consider whether interim goals should be listed as categorically excluded, generally requiring an EIS, or generally requiring an Environmental Assessment but not necessarily an EIS. IV. Project Implementation Reports Approved Pursuant to Transition Rule Section 601(h)(3)(D) of WRDA 2000 establishes a transition rule for Project Implementation Reports approved before the date of promulgation of the programmatic regulations.
This transition rule requires that the Project Implementation Reports be consistent with the Plan.
The transition rule also requires that the preamble of the programmatic regulations contain a statement concerning the consistency with the programmatic regulations of the Project Implementation Reports approved prior to the date of promulgation of those regulations.
A number of Project Implementation Reports are underway currently, but no Project Implementation Reports have been approved to date.
The Project Implementation Report for the Southern Golden Gates Estates project in Collier County is scheduled to be completed prior to promulgation of the final rule.
If the final Project Implementation Report on Southern Golden Gates Estates is approved before the date of VerDate Jul
``Policies that have federalism implications'' is defined in the Executive Order to include regulations that have ``substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.''
These regulations do not have significant federalism implications.
The proposed regulations define the relationships between the Federal and State partners in implementing the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan.
These proposed regulations are limited to implementation of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan.
It will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government, as specified in Executive Order 13132.
Thus, Executive Order 13132 does not apply to this rule.
Nonetheless, the Corps of Engineers has consulted closely with the State and local officials in developing the proposed rule.
D. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., as amended by the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA) of 1996) generally requires an agency to prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis of any rule subject to notice-and-comment rulemaking requirements under the Administrative Procedure Act or any other statute unless the agency certifies that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
Small entities include small businesses, small organizations and small governmental jurisdictions.
For purposes of assessing the impacts of the proposed rule on small entities, a small entity is defined as: (1) A small business based on SBA size standards; (2) a small governmental jurisdiction that is a government of a city, county, town, school district, or special district with a population of less than 50,000; and (3) a small organization that is any not-for-profit enterprise which is independently owned and operated and is not dominant in its field.
After considering the economic impacts of the proposed rule on small entities, we certify that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
The proposed regulations only establish processes and governmental relationships that will be used for implementation of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan.
E. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act We have determined in accordance with the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (2 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.): (a) These regulations will not ``significantly or uniquely'' affect small governments.
A Small Government Agency Plan is not required.
Small governments will only be affected to the extent that they agree to act as a nonFederal sponsor for implementation of projects for the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan.
The proposed regulations do not establish new or different requirements for nonFederal sponsors for implementation of projects for the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan.
(b) The proposed regulations will not produce a Federal mandate of $100 million or greater in any year, and therefore, does not constitute a ``significant regulatory action'' under the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act.
The regulations define processes and relationships between the Federal and State partners in implementing the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan.
The regulations do not affect the cost sharing requirements for nonFederal sponsors in implementing the Plan and therefore, imposes no new obligations on State or local governments.
F. National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act Section 12(d) of the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (the NTTAA), Public Law 104113, section 12(d) (15 U.S.C. 272 note), directs us to use voluntary consensus standards in our regulatory activities unless to do so would be inconsistent with applicable law or otherwise impractical.
Voluntary consensus standards are technical standards (e.g., materials specifications, test methods, sampling procedures, and business practices) that are developed or adopted by voluntary consensus standards bodies.
The NTTAA directs us to provide Congress, through OMB, explanations when we decide not to use available and applicable voluntary consensus standards.
These regulations do not involve technical standards.
50551 Therefore, we did not consider the use of any voluntary consensus standards.
G. Executive Order 13045 Executive Order 13045, entitled ``Protection of Children From Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks'' (62 FR 19885, April 23, 1997), applies to any rule that: (1) Was initiated after April 21, 1997, or for which a notice of proposed rulemaking was published after April 21, 1998; (2) is determined to be ``economically significant'' as defined under Executive Order 12866, and (3) concerns an environmental health or safety risk that we have reason to believe may have a disproportionate effect on children.
If the regulatory action meets all three criteria, we must evaluate the environmental health or safety effects of the planned rule on children, and explain why the planned regulation is preferable to other potentially effective and reasonably feasible alternatives that we considered.
The regulations are not subject to Executive Order 13045 because it is not an economically significant regulatory action as defined by Executive Order 12866.
The regulations establish processes for the implementation of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan and define the relationships between the Federal and State partners for implementation.

H. Executive Order 13175 Under Executive Order 13175, we may not issue a regulation that has substantial, direct effects on one or more Indian tribes, on the relationship between the Federal government and Indian tribes, or on the distribution of powers and responsibilities between the Federal government and Indian tribes, and imposes substantial direct compliance costs on those communities, and that is not required by statute, unless the Federal government provides the funds necessary to pay the direct compliance cost incurred by the Tribal governments, or we consult with those governments.
If we comply by consulting, Executive Order 13175 requires us to provide the Office of Management and Budget, in a separately identified section of the preamble to the rule, a description of the extent of our prior consultation with representatives of affected Tribal governments, a summary of the nature of their concerns, and a statement supporting the need to issue the regulation.

K. Executive Order 13211 On May 18, 2001, the President issued an Executive Order (E.O. 13211) that applies to regulations that significantly affect energy supply, distribution, and use.
Executive Order 13211 requires agencies to prepare Statements of Energy Effects when undertaking certain actions.
Because the proposed regulations are not expected to significantly affect energy supplies, distribution, or use, this action is not a significant energy action and no Statement of Energy Effects is required.
L. Environmental Documentation We have determined that these proposed regulations do not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.
Therefore, environmental documentation under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) is not required for these proposed regulations.
The Corps of Engineers has prepared appropriate environmental documentation, including a Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement, for the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan.
Moreover, the proposed regulations establish requirements for the preparation of appropriate environmental documentation as part of the implementation process.

elected officials and other representatives of Indian Tribal governments ``to provide meaningful and timely input in the development of regulatory policies on matters that significantly or uniquely affect their communities.''
The proposed regulations are required by section 601(h)(3) of WRDA 2000.
Additionally, the proposed rule does not impose significant compliance costs on any Indian Tribes.
The regulations establish processes for the implementation of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan and define the relationships between the implementing entities.
Accordingly, the requirements of section 3(b) of Executive Order 13175 do not apply to these regulations.
However, the Corps of Engineers recognizes that two Indian Tribes, the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida and the Seminole Tribe of Florida, have a significant direct interest in the implementation of the CERP and the framework for its implementation that will be established by these programmatic regulations.
We have thus consulted extensively with these Tribes in the development of this proposed rule, and have included requirements for continued consultation in all significant project implementation components, including program-wide guidance memoranda, Project Management Plans, Program Management Plans, Project Implementation Reports, Project Operating Manuals, the System Operating Manual, and the Master Implementation Sequencing Plan.
These Tribes are also included in the Leadership Group of RECOVER and participate in the Project Delivery Teams and the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force, which has played and will continue to play a consultative role on many aspects of CERP implementation.
Finally, Ã¯Â¿Â½ 385.10(b) includes a general requirement for consultation with the Tribes ``throughout the implementation process.''
I. Executive Order 12630 In accordance with Executive Order 12630 entitled ``Governmental Actions and Interference with Constitutionally Protected Property Rights,'' the proposed regulations will not effect a taking of private property or otherwise have taking implications.
A takings implication assessment is not required.
The regulations establish processes to be used in implementing the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan.

(c) The goal of the Plan is to provide the quantity, quality, timing, and distribution of water necessary to achieve the goals and purposes of the Plan.
The Corps of Engineers and nonFederal sponsors shall implement the projects of the Plan with the goal of achieving the expected performance level of the Plan and to seek continuous improvement of the Plan based upon new information resulting from changed or unforeseen circumstances, new scientific or technical information, new or updated models, or information developed through the adaptive assessment principles contained in the Plan, or future authorized changes to the Plan integrated into the implementation of the Plan.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ 385.9 Implementation principles.
the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, the Seminole Tribe of Florida, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, and other Federal, State, and local agencies, conduct activities, including programlevel activities, necessary to implement the projects of the Plan.
Such activities shall be conducted as part of an integrated implementation program, in accordance with this part, and based on the following principles: (a) Individual projects shall be formulated based on their contribution to the system-wide goals and purposes of the Plan and the achievement of the expected performance level of the Plan, as well as on their ability to provide benefits without regard to projects not yet implemented.
(b) Interim goals shall be established pursuant to this part to provide a means for evaluating restoration success at specific time intervals during implementation.
Progress on achieving other water-related needs of the region as provided for in the Plan shall also be evaluated at specific time intervals during implementation.
(c) Endorsement of the Plan as a restoration framework is not intended as a constraint on innovation in its implementation through the adaptive management process.
Continuous improvement of the Plan shall be sought to ensure that new information resulting from changed or unforeseen circumstances, new scientific or technical information, or information developed through the adaptive assessment principles contained in the Plan, or future authorized changes to the Plan are integrated into the implementation of the Plan.

(b) Identification of water to be reserved or allocated for the natural system in the Project Implementation Report.
(1) Each Project Implementation Report shall take into account the preCERP baseline water and previously reserved water in identifying the appropriate quantity, timing, and distribution of water dedicated and managed for the natural system, determining whether improvements in water quality are necessary to ensure that water delivered to the natural system meets applicable water quality standards; and identifying the amount of water for the natural system necessary to implement, under State law, the provisions of section 601(h)(4)(A)(iii)(V) of WRDA 2000.
(2) Section 601(h)(3)(C)(i)(I) of WRDA 2000 requires the programmatic regulations in this part to establish a process for development of Project Implementation Reports, Project Cooperation Agreements, and Operating Manuals that ensure that the goals and objectives of the Plan are achieved.
Section 601(h)(4)(A)(iii)(IV) of WRDA 2000 provides that Project Implementation Reports shall identify the appropriate quantity, timing, and distribution of water dedicated and managed for the natural system.
Section 601(h)(4)(A)(iii)(V) of WRDA 2000 provides that Project Implementation Reports shall identify the amount of water to be reserved or allocated for the natural system necessary to implement, under State law, the provisions of section 601(h)(4)(A)(iii)(IV) and (VI) of WRDA 2000.
To implement these provisions and Ã¯Â¿Â½ 385.5, the Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District shall, with the concurrence of the Secretary of the Interior and the Governor, develop a guidance memorandum for use of the Corps of Engineers and the non-federal sponsor.
The guidance memorandum shall provide a process to be used in the preparation of Project Implementation Reports for identifying the appropriate quantity, timing, and distribution of water dedicated and managed for the natural system; determining whether improvements in water quality are necessary to ensure that water delivered to the natural system meets applicable water quality standards; and identifying the amount of water for the natural system necessary to implement, under State law, the provisions of section 601(h)(4)(A)(iii) of WRDA 2000.
(i) The guidance memorandum shall generally be based on a system-wide analysis that adds the project recommended in the Project Implementation Report to the projects of the Plan for which Project Implementation Reports have already been implemented and may express the quantity, timing and distribution of water in stage duration curves; exceedance frequency curves; quantities available in average, wet, and dry years; or any other method which is based on the best available science.
The guidance memorandum shall also provide for projects that are hydrologically separate from the rest of the system.
The guidance memorandum also shall address procedures for determining whether improvements in water quality are necessary to ensure that water delivered to the natural system meets applicable water quality standards.
These procedures shall ensure that any features to improve water quality are implemented in a manner consistent with the cost sharing provisions of the Water Resources Development Acts of 1996 and 2000.
(ii) The guidance memorandum shall generally take into account the natural fluctuation of water made available in any given year; the objective of restoration of the natural system; the need for protection of existing uses transferred to new sources; contingencies for drought protection; the need to identify the additional quantity, timing, and distribution of water made available by a new project component while maintaining a systemwide perspective on the amount of water made available by the Plan; and the need to determine whether improvements in water quality are necessary to ensure that water delivered to the natural system meets applicable water quality standards.
(iii) Project Implementation Reports approved before the date of promulgation of these regulations or the development of the guidance memorandum may use whatever method that the Corps of Engineers and the non-Federal sponsor deem is reasonable and consistent with the provisions of section 601 of WRDA 2000.
(iv) Nothing in this section is intended to, or shall it be interpreted to, reserve or allocate water or to prescribe the process for reserving or allocating water or for water management under Florida law.
Nothing in this section is intended to, nor shall it be interpreted to, prescribe any process of Florida law.
and Southern Florida Project prior to the date of enactment of section 601 of WRDA 2000.

(2) Concurrence by the Secretary of the Interior and the Governor shall be required on the proposed pre-CERP baseline.
Within 180 days from the development of the pre-CERP baseline, or December 31, 2003, whichever is sooner, or such shorter period that the Secretary of the Interior and the Governor may agree to, the Secretary of the Interior and the Governor may provide the Secretary with a written statement of concurrence or nonconcurrence with the proposed preCERP baseline.
A failure to provide a written statement of concurrence or nonconcurrence within such time frame shall be deemed as meeting the concurrency requirements of this section.
Any nonconcurrency statement shall specifically detail the reason or reasons for the non-concurrence.
The Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District shall give good faith consideration to any nonconcurrency statement, and take the reason or reasons for the nonconcurrence into account in the final decision to determine the preCERP baseline.
(3) In preparing a Project Implementation Report, the Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District shall determine whether the pre-CERP baseline quantity of water of comparable quality is still available.
The Corps of Engineers and the non-Federal sponsor shall consider any change in availability of pre-CERP baseline water and previously reserved water in identifying the quantity, timing, and distribution of water to be made available for the natural system by a project component in preparing the Project Implementation Report.
The Project Implementation Report shall consider: whether additional quantity, timing, and distribution of water should be made available by subsequent projects; whether improvements in water quality are needed in order to ensure that water delivered to the natural system meets applicable water quality standards; whether to recommend preparation of a Comprehensive Plan Modification Report as described in Ã¯Â¿Â½ 385.32; and whether to recommend that the State of Florida and its agencies re-examine the reservation or allocation of water made pursuant to State law in order to VerDate Jul
50571 (a) Pursuant to the provisions of section 601(h)(5)(A) of WRDA 2000, Project Implementation Reports shall include analyses to determine if existing legal sources of water are to be transferred or eliminated as a result of project implementation.
If implementation of the project shall cause a transfer or elimination of existing legal sources of water, then the Project Implementation Report shall include an implementation plan that ensures that such transfer or elimination shall not occur until a new source of water of comparable quantity and quality is available to replace the water to be lost as a result of implementation of the Plan.
(b) In determining if implementation of a project shall cause an elimination or transfer of existing legal sources of water, the Corps of Engineers and the non-Federal sponsor shall include those for: (1) An agricultural or urban water supply; (2) Allocation or entitlement to the Seminole Indian Tribe of Florida under section 7 of the Seminole Indian Land Claims Settlement Act of 1987 (25 U.S.C. 1772e); (3) The Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida; (4) Water supply for Everglades National Park; or (5) Water supply for fish and wildlife.

a minimum every five years beginning October 1, 2005, to determine if the Interim Goals should be revised.
Thereafter, the Secretary, the Secretary of the Interior, and the Governor shall revise the interim goals as appropriate and execute a new agreement every five years.
However, they may revise interim goals whenever appropriate as new information becomes available.
Any revisions to interim goals shall be adopted consistent with the process established pursuant to this part.
(d) Principles for developing interim goals.
(1) RECOVER, using best available science and information, shall recommend a set of interim goals for implementation of CERP, consisting of regional hydrologic performance targets, improvements in water quality, and anticipated ecological responses for areas such as, Lake Okeechobee, the Kissimmee River Region, the Water Conservation Areas, the Lower East Coast, the Upper East Coast, the Everglades Agricultural Area, and the Caloosahatchee River, Everglades National Park, Big Cypress National Preserve, and the estuaries.
These interim goals shall reflect the incremental accomplishment of the expected performance level of the Plan, and will identify improvements in quantity, quality, timing and distribution of water in five-year increments beginning in 2005.
The interim goals shall be predicted by appropriate models and tools and shall provide a quantitative basis for evaluating the restoration success of the Plan during the period of implementation.
The expected performance level of the Plan is generally represented by the output of the model run of D13R as described in the ``Final Integrated Feasibility Report and Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement'' dated April 1, 1999, as modified by section 601 of WRDA 2000, or any subsequent modification authorized in law.
In developing the interim goals for the five-year increments, RECOVER shall use the Master Implementation Sequencing Plan as the basis for predicting the increments.
RECOVER may recommend additional interim goals for implementation of CERP in addition to those initially developed and may propose revisions to the initial set of hydrologic interim goals as new information is gained through adaptive management.
(2) In developing its recommendations for interim goals, RECOVER shall consider indicators including, but not limited to: (i) Hydrologic indicators, including: (a) Purpose.
(1) The overarching objective of the Plan is the restoration, preservation, and protection of the South Florida ecosystem while providing for other water-related needs of the region, including water supply and flood protection.
Progress towards providing for these other water-related needs shall also be evaluated.
(2) As provided for in paragraph (b) of this section, the Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District shall establish targets for evaluating progress towards achieving other water-related needs of the region, including water supply and flood protection, throughout the implementation process.
