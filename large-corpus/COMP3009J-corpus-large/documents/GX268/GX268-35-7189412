(1) Minimum Space Requirements (a) The cage must be large enough to provide full body extension without contact with the confines.
The cage must be wide enough in at least one direction to accommodate completely stretched wings.
(b) A single well-placed perch may be adequate for Psittacines ie., the bird can stand completely upright on the perch without having the head contact the ceiling of the cage and at the same time not having the tail contact the floor or grate.
For those species, such as Finches, Canaries, etc. that prefer flying or jumping to climbing, two perches, one at each end of the cage, must be provided.
Perches must be strategically placed to prevent droppings from contaminating other birds and the birds' food and water and to also prevent the bird's tail from coming into contact with the food and water.
(c) Minimum space requirements for multiple birds housed temporarily depends on the calculated Housing Density Factor and the overall length of the bird as measured from the tip of the tail to the top of the head.
The following calculation will be used to determine the number of birds that can be housed in a given cage:
28
L x W x H Ã· Density Factor = total length of birds permitted.
Total length of birds permitted Ã· length of bird = number of birds allowed in that size cage Housing Density Factor Table: Species Finch Parakeet Cockatiel Cockatiel-type Amazon Cockatoo Macaw Each bird's overall length (in.) 3 8 9-12 9-12 (heavier body) 13-24 25-35 34-45 Density Factor 60 50 60 75 325 800 1400
Cage measurements are based on the actual living space and do not include T-stands or perches attached to the outside of the cage or the space below the cage grate.
(d) For birds housed over 60 days, the Density Factor should be doubled for birds 12 inches in overall length or less.
For birds housed over 90 days, the Density Factor shall be doubled for birds 12 inches in overall length or less.
(e) All cage accessories (ladders, toys, perches, etc.) made of unsealed wood shall be cleaned daily and replaced as often as necessary to maintain sanitary conditions.
regulations pertaining (f) For breeding birds see Section 13.00. to
c. Outdoor Aviaries.
The size, shape, and design of the cages shall be appropriate for the species being housed and shall allow space, without overcrowding, for the normal exercise requirements of each bird.
Flight cages shall be constructed to prevent injury to birds.
A
29
covered portion of each cage shall be provided where birds can avoid direct sunlight or adverse weather conditions and commingling with noncaptive animals.
d. Freshwater Fish.
The primary enclosure for freshwater fish is an aquarium, fish tank, or pond.
The size of the aquarium is determined by the size, number and behavioral characteristics of the fish.
The number of fish kept in the aquarium can be increased substantially by frequent water changes and/or auxiliary filtration.
(1) Aquariums and ponds can be constucted of glass, plastic, acrylic, wood, or metal.
Ponds can be constructed of materials such as rubber, fiberglass, rock, concrete and similar materials.
(2) Aquariums and ponds shall be in good repair and maintain adequate water levels to sustain aquatic life.
(3) Aquarium lids, constructed from glass or plastic, can be used to keep dust out and prevent fish from escaping.
When aquarium lids are used they should not provide an airtight barrier.
(4) Substrate.
Quartz gravel or epoxycoated rock chips or pebbles should be used as the filter bed material to cover the bottom of the freshwater aquarium if an underground filter is utilized.
Filter-bed material will be a minimum of 1 inch thick across the entire bottom of the aquarium.
(5) Filtration Systems.
Filtration systems will be employed to remove the waste products produced by the fish and to enhance the quality of the water and shall include individually or in combination biological, mechanical and chemical types.
(a) Common types of filtration systems used by pet animal dealerships include undergravel filters, outside power
30
filters, canister fliters, filters, and sponge filters.
wet/dry
(b) Labyrinth fish, such as Bettas, do not require the use of filtration systems, but must have the water in the primary enclosure changed at least weekly.
(6) Water Quality Maintenance.
Good water quality and water chemistry, as measured using commercially available test kits, are essential to maintain a healthy aquarium environment for the fish.
(a) Water chemistry shall be tested to make sure the following specific criteria are within prescribed limits for established aquariums: Free ammonia concentration Â­ the presence of free ammonia indicates that the biological filter is not working properly or the aquarium is overcrowded or overfed.
The maximum acceptable level of free ammonia in a healthy aquarium is 1 ppm. PH Â­ measures the acidity or the alkalinity of the water.
The PH reading can vary from 5.5 to 9.0 depending on the requirements of a particular species of fish.
(b) Any time more than 30% water change with chlorinated water occurs, the aquarium shall be treated with a water conditioner that will specifically remove chlorine and/or chloramines.
(c) Dead fish shall be removed from the enclosure a minimum of once daily, or more often if necessary.
(7) Water Temperature Control.
The water in a freshwater aquarium shall normally be
31
maintained at a temperature of 68 to 82 degrees Fahrenheit for tropical fish, as appropriate to the species.
If necessary, a thermostatically controlled heater shall be used to maintain the required temperature.
The heater should be capable of delivering 2 to 5 watts per gallon.
Accurate water temperature will be measured by a suitable aquarium thermometer.
(8) Feeding and Nutrition.
(a) Freshwater fish shall be fed on a routine basis to maintain good fish health and to maintain good water quality.
(b) A variety of foods shall be provided such as flake, frozen, live and dried pellets to ensure that all the fish in the aquarium, including bottom dwellers, are fed. e. Saltwater Fish.
The primary enclosure for saltwater fish is the aquarium or fish tank.
The size of the aquarium is determined by the size, number and type of marine fish and invertebrates.
The surface area of the tank (length and width) is more critical than the depth of the tank.
The larger the surface area and the more frequent the water changes, the greater the fish population can be.
(1) Aquariums can be constructed of glass, plastic, acrylic, or specially treated wood.
(2) Aquariums shall be in good repair and watertight.
(3) Aquarium lids, constructed from glass or plastic, can be used to keep dirt out, minimize tank water evaporation and prevent fish from escaping.
When aquarium lids are used they should not provide an air-tight barrier.
32
(4) Substrate.
When necessary to use a substrate in a saltwater aquarium only materials with a calcareous composition such as coral sand, limestone, oyster shell, dolomite, and the like shall be used.
When used together with an undergravel filter the depth of the substrate shall be 1Â½ to 3 inches to satisfy biological requirements.
(5) Filtration Systems.
Filtration systems will be employed to remove the waste produced by the fish and to enhance the quality of the water and can include, individually or in combination, biological (removes ammonia and ammonia products); mechanical (removes particulate matter); and chemical (removes dissolved organic compounds) types.
(6) Water Quality Maintenance.
Good water quality and water chemistry, as measured using commercially available test kits, are essential to maintain a healthy aquarium environment for the fish and invertebrates.
(a) Water make sure criteria limits for chemistry shall be tested to that the following specific are within the prescribed established aquariums:
Combined ammonia (NH 3 + NH 4) Â­ 0.25 ppm maximum.
PH Â­ 7.8 to 8.5.
Specific gravity (salinity) Â­ 1.018 to 1.024 at 75 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit as measured by a hydrometer.
Nitrite (intermediate step in nitrogen cycle) Â­ 0.5 ppm maximum.
the
Nitrate (chemical product of nitrite conversion) Â­ 60 ppm maximum for fish and 40 ppm maximum for invertebrates.
The recommended levels are 30 ppm for fish and 20 ppm for invertebrates.
33
(b) Dead fish shall be removed from the enclosure once daily, or more often if necessary.
(7) Water Temperature Control.
The water in a tropical saltwater aquarium shall normally be maintained at a temperature of 72 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit.
If it is necessary to use a thermostatically controlled heater to maintain the required temperature, the heater should be capable of delivering 2 to 5 watts per gallon.
Accurate water temperature will be measured using a suitable aquarium thermometer.
(8) Lighting.
For proper keeping of corals and other invertebrates, the photoperiod (amount of time the aquarium light is on) is very important and should not be less than 10 hours.
The spectrum of lighting used will be appropriate to the species.
(9) Feeding and Nutrition.
(a) Saltwater fish and invertebrates shall be fed as appropriate to the species, a minimum of 3 times per week.
(b) A variety of foods shall be provided such as flake, dried pellets, frozen, live and complex nutrient liquids for filter feeding invertebrates. a.
Reptiles and Amphibians.
(1) Standard Husbandry Requirements. reptiles and amphibians, regardless species, shall be provided with following basic environmental maintenance needs: All of the and
(a) Housing/Enclosures.
The primary enclosures shall be constructed of materials such as glass, acrylic, wire, and wood and of suitable size to prevent overcrowding.
The enclosure
34
will be constructed so as to keep the animal safely within.
(b) Ground Medium.
The bottom of the primary enclosure shall be covered with a substrate material that is suitable for the particular species, eg. sand for desert lizards; moistened potting soil (without perlite) or fine to medium grade orchid bark for forest lizards, box turtles, and some frogs; brown wrapping paper and newspaper for the White's tree frog; and pine shavings and alfalfa pellets for snakes, to name a few examples.
(c) Landscaping.
The primary enclosure shall be provided with a variety of structures, materials and plants, as appropriate, to meet the needs and satisfy behavioral characteristics of different species.
Suitable landscaping materials include rocks, dried branches, vertical sections of cholla wood and cork bark slabs for climbing; natural or commercially produced shelters, both vertical and horizontal, to protect the animal and reduce stress; and various live and/or artificial plants to help recreate the animal's natural environment.
(d) Basking Areas.
When appropriate to the species, a basking area affording both heat and light shall be provided so that the animal can selfregulate its body temperature to improve digestion of food, improve appetite and reduce respiratory infections.
The objective is to establish an area within the primary enclosure where a temperature gradient is created where both the air and surface temperature decrease as the distance from the heat source increases.
35
A basking area can be easily created by locating an incandescent lightbulb or spotlight in a reflector-type fixture above the basking surface to radiate heat onto a flat rock or along the length of wood branch or piece of cork bark diagonally placed in the primary enclosure.
Acceptable secondary heat sources can include such items as hot rock-type heaters, undertank heating pads, and ceramic infrared element bulbs with the correct wattage for the primary enclosure size.
(e) Temperature Control.
Maintenance of the correct environmental temperature, air or water, is essential for the proper health and well being of the animal.
The specific temperature requirement depends on the particular species; the climate of the animal's natural environment, eg. desert/semiarid, temperate, subtropical, tropical, mountain or shoreline; and the location of the temperature measurement i.e. nearest the heat and light source (basking area), furthest away from the heat source (shelter), or nighttime temperature.
i. A thermometer shall be used to determine the temperature inside the primary enclosure. ii. Typical temperature ranges (Fahrenheit) for most reptiles and amphibians are: air (68-95); basking (80-95); nighttime (6585). (f) of Lighting.
Depending on the needs the particular species, an
36
incandescent bulb with a reflector-type fixture will be provided to develop the necessary temperature gradient inside the primary enclosure.
The recommended photo period is twelve hours on and twelve hours off. (g) Water.
Potable water shall be provided, whether for drinking, primary environment or soaking.
Depending upon the species, fresh drinking water shall be made available a minimum of once per day or more often if necessary, in a shallow container, heavy crock, etc. or by misting plants and sides of the primary enclosure or through the use of an overhead drip system to drip water on plant leaves.
(h) Feeding.
The diets of reptiles and amphibians in captivity are as varied as the number of species and range from crickets, wax worms, mealworms and wingless fruitflies (for insect eating lizards); floating foods, guppies, goldfish, earthworms and finely chopped mixed vegetable (for water turtles); crickets, mealworms, earthworms, strawberries, cantaloupe, romaine lettuce and tomatoes (for box turtles); crickets, "pinky" and "fuzzy" mice (for White's tree frogs); to goldfish, mice, rats, rabbits and poultry for snakes.
i. Successful feeding of a particular species shall take into account not only diet, but also size of prey vs. size of animal's head, frequency of feeding, amount of food and environmental factors such as heat, light, humidity, and proper landscaping that significantly affect feeding response.
37
ii.
In addition to a well balanced and varied diet, commercial vitamin/mineral and calcium supplements (in powdered form) shall be put on the appropriate animal's food every 3 to 4 feedings. (i) Primary Enclosure Maintenance.
The primary enclosure shall be cleaned at least weekly or more often if necessary to remove feces and soiled ground medium or substrate.
For water turtles, the enclosure water shall be changed weekly or more often if necessary to minimize animal health hazards and odors.
Clean and sanitize drinking water containers and soaking and bathing containers weekly or more often if necessary.
(j) Specialized Husbandry Requirements i. Lizards.
Dimensions of the primary enclosure for a single animal, excluding the tail, shall be: Length Â­ 1Â½ times the length of the animal; width - Â½ the length of the animal; height - 6 inches minimum.
Minimal space requirements for multiple animals within a given primary enclosure shall be based on the following calculation: L x W x H Ã· Density Factor = total length of animals permitted.
Total length of animals permitted Ã· length of animal = number of animals allowed in that size enclosure.
The calculated density factor varies with the length range of the lizard being housed.
("DF" is density factor.)

Humidity levels can be increased in the primary enclosure by using a ground medium that contains water in the enclosure and/or partially sealing the top of the enclosure to decrease the rate of evaporation.
(k) Water turtles.
Minimum space requirements for multiple animals within a given primary enclosure shall be based on the following calculation: L x W x H Ã· Density Factor = total length of animals permitted.
Height in the equation is equivalent to the depth of water in the enclosure.
For a water turtle with 6 inches as measured diagonally across the carapace, the DF is 30.
The depth of water in the primary enclosure shall be at least equal to the carapace length of the turtle with a gradual access leading to a basking area.
The deeper the water, the wider the range of normal behavior that can be exhibited.
