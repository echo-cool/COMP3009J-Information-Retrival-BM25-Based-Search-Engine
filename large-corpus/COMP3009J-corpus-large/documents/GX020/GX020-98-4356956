The FRA is charged with the task of assessing standards developed by the Association of American Railroads (AAR) on crashworthiness and working conditions that affect safety and productivity.
As part of this effort, the FRA conducted research to address these issues.

The guidelines will serve as a decision-making tool for evaluating current and proposed locomotive designs and, in particular, standards developed by the AAR for defining basic industry requirements in cab design.

While there is a rich body of human factors research, for the most part it was not written and organized for use by those developing or evaluating complex systems, like the locomotive cab.
The available literature is located in diverse places that include journal articles, technical publications, textbooks and conference proceedings.
Where there are human factors guidelines available, they are often general in nature and have not been tailored to accommodate the specific requirements of the railroad environment.
<
<
Our understanding of human factors issues affecting locomotive engineers and others who work in the cab is still incomplete.
As this document is being prepared, many of the issues surrounding the incorporation of new information technology are still being debated.
The currently available literature frequently does not address the capabilities of this new technology (Rogers and Myers, 1993).
Future research and continuing dialogue will be needed as the locomotive cab evolves to incorporate this new technology.
How the locomotive engineer will interact with this new technology should be a central part of this debate.
<
To make the guidelines as relevant as possible, members of the railroad community were consulted (the major railroads, manufacturers, AAR and the railroad unions) to better understand the current problems with current cab designs and obtain a sense of what the future needs are likely to be.
<

Environmental working conditions (e.g., noise and seating) and how it affects operator performance have been a concern of the railroads, manufacturers and train engineers for many years.
The second theme revolves around the incorporation of information technology into the locomotive cab.
The problems of how to incorporate new information
<
<
<
This emphasis reflects the concerns of engineers who have identified many of the ergonomic problems within the locomotive cab.
Currently, those concerns center on crew comfort.
As those problems are solved, the relative effort focusing on information processing as it relates to train control will grow.
<

Crew comfort in the cab compartment trailed that found in passenger compartments and other working environments.
Noise, ventilation, and seating are three examples of problem areas that affected crew comfort, safety, and productivity.
Although human factors considerations are an important consideration in the design of the current generation of locomotives, the long service life of locomotives means that these concerns will exist for some time.
Approximately, 19 percent of locomotives in service in 1994 were built before 1970 (AAR, 1994).
Thus, noise levels in a significant number of cabs exceed federal regulations for this working environment and are loud enough to permanently impair hearing (Gamst, 1975).
Railroads have responded to this problem by providing hearing protection equipment.
The lack of proper ventilation in the cab results in hot and cold spots in cab, inadequate heating in cold weather, and inadequate cooling in hot weather as well as noxious fumes vented inside the cab (Gamst, 1975).
These conditions contribute to health problems and crew fatigue.
<
<
Other important human factors concerns with working conditions in the cab include: safely entering and exiting the cab, adequate visibility, and sanitary toilet facilities.
<
<
The incorporation of this technology will affect how the locomotive engineer performs his or her job.
<
<
In the past, this interface consisted of electromechanical dials, gauges and levers, and control knobs.
This interface is being replaced with workstations that consist of computer displays and controls (i.e., CRT or LCD displays and keyboards).
New technology and new designs may not necessarily make new locomotives better than previous versions.
The design of a complex man-machine system, like a locomotive cab, involves making trade-offs and compromises to meet customer requirements and yet stay within cost and schedule limitations.
This knowledge will be acquired over time as locomotive cab designs evolve and we gain experience from other transportation modalities, as well as testing the usability of proposed designs.
<
<
These issues represent the needs of the engineers, conductors and maintenance staff who will work in this environment as well as the constraints faced by the manufacturers who design and build the locomotive and the railroads who purchase and operate them.
Some of the major operational issues are discussed below: 
<
<
Some characteristics date back to steam era traditions.
The long service life of locomotives makes compatibility with previous designs an important issue, since a railroad may own locomotives with cab configurations from different design eras. 
<
<
The incorporation of new features which address new capability while retaining old features helps the engineer to learn the new system more quickly, since only the new features must be learned.
<
<
<
Standardization makes design and manufacturing easier for the builder and operation easier for the end user, the engineer (when transitioning from one cab to another).
However, railroad properties can specify considerable individual modifications.
Ergonomic considerations, including consideration of the anthropometry of the user population, are often out of the hands of the builder.
It must put together the components to give the customers what they want, even where customer requirements deviate from the ideal.
For some areas (e.g., noise limits), there are currently accepted standards that are based on practical limitations.
Where these standards exist, they are cited.
However, the report also cites goals which should be strived for and that are more supportive of the safety, health productivity and comfort of the engineer.

A number of proposed designs are being considered to address bi-directionality in future locomotive cabs.
One proposal would place the controls in the arm rest of the engineers
Another proposal would divide the locomotive into two units, one containing the cab controls and another generating the power.
The locomotive cab would be isolated from the power unit and could be turned around to operate in either direction.
<
<
<
A hidden cost is the effect on performance, safety, and working conditions when various subsystems and components within the cab are not adequately maintained.
<
<
<
<
<
<
<
These topics address how the engineer obtains information about the status of the locomotive and how train control is implemented.
<
<
The discussion of operational issues is specific to the locomotive cab environment.
The human factors considerations provide a background discussion of the research contributing to individual guidelines.
Chapter 1 gives an overview of the issues that are influencing future locomotive cab designs and basic human factors principles that need to be considered while chapter 2 contains key points from each of the following chapters.
The key points summarize the specific human factors recommendations for a particular issue.
<
U.S. railroads have usually used English units (i.e., feet and inches) to indicate measurement quantities.
Recently, locomotive manufacturers have adopted the use of metric units for indicating measurement information in their designs.
Measurement information derived from standards developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) also use metric units.
Conversion factors are presented at the beginning of this document to aid the reader to convert between metric or English units.

Authors collected and reviewed papers, handbooks, reference guides applicable to human-machine systems in general as well as materials specific to the problems of locomotive cab design and operation.
To make the guidelines as relevant as possible we spoke with members of the railroad community to better understand the current problems with current cab designs and obtain a sense of what the future needs are likely to be and how they may be accommodated.
