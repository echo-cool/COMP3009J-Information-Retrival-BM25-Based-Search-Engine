: Semiannual regulatory agenda.
SUMMARY: The regulatory agenda is a semiannual summary of all current and projected rulemakings, reviews of existing regulations, and completed actions of the Department.
The agenda provides the public with information about the Department of Transportation's regulatory activity.
It is expected that this information will enable the public to be more aware of and allow it to more effectively participate in the Department's regulatory activity.
The public is also invited to submit comments to continuously open regulatory review dockets, suggesting items for consideration as part of the Department's ongoing review of existing regulations.

Background Improvement of Government regulations is a prime goal of the Clinton Administration.
There should be no more regulations than necessary, and those that are issued should be simpler, more comprehensible, and less burdensome.
Regulations should not be issued without appropriate involvement of the public; once issued, they should be periodically reviewed and revised, as needed, to assure that they continue to meet the needs for which they originally were designed.
To help the Department of Transportation (Department) achieve these goals and in accordance with Executive Order 12866 ``Regulatory Planning and Review'' (58 FR 51735; October 4, 1993) and the Department's Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979), the Department prepares a semiannual regulatory agenda for publication in the Federal Register.
The agenda summarizes all current and projected rulemaking, reviews of existing regulations, and completed actions of the Department.
These are matters on which action has begun or is projected during the succeeding 12 months or such longer period as may be
The mailing address for the initiating offices of the Department that appear in the agenda is 400 7th Street SW., Washington, DC 20590; except for the Federal Aviation Administration, which is located at 800 Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC 20591, and the U.S. Coast Guard, which is located at 2100 2nd Street SW., Washington, DC 20593.
ADDRESSES: FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:
General For further information on the agenda in general, contact: Neil R. Eisner, Assistant General Counsel for Regulation and Enforcement, Department of Transportation, 400 7th Street SW., Washington, DC 20590, (202) 366-4723.
anticipated or for which action has been completed since the last agenda.
The agendas are based on reports submitted by the initiating offices in January and July each year.
After these reports are consolidated for and reviewed by the Department Regulations Council, the Department's regulations agenda is prepared and published in the Federal Register.
The Department's last agenda was published in the Federal Register on April 25, 1997 (62 FR 21990).
The next one is scheduled for publication in the Federal Register in April 1998.
For this edition of the Department's regulatory agenda, the most important significant regulatory actions are included in The Regulatory Plan, which appears in Part II of this issue of the Federal Register.
The Regulatory Plan entries are listed in the Table of Contents below and are denoted by a bracketed bold reference, which directs the reader to the appropriate Sequence Number in Part II.
As a result of the ICC Termination Act of 1995, the Surface Transportation Board, successor to the ICC, has become part of this Department.
However, the Surface Transportation Board publishes its rulemaking activities with other independent regulatory agencies in the Unified Agenda.
Regulatory Flexibility Act In 1980, Congress passed the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), Public Law 96-354, which requires the designation of those regulations for which a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis will be prepared; i.e., those regulations that would have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
A Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is required for a rulemaking which, in the heading ``Small Entities Affected,'' indicates an effect on small businesses, governmental jurisdictions, or organizations.
If a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis will be prepared for a particular rulemaking, that fact also will be noted under the heading ``Analysis.''
The RFA also requires that, each year, the Department publish a list of those regulations that have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities and are to be reviewed under the Act during the succeeding 12 months.
The agenda includes those regulations to be reviewed under the RFA or those for
Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 209 / Wednesday, October 29, 1997 / Unified Agenda DOT
57771
which review has been concluded since the last agenda.
The phrase (Section 610 Review) appears at the end of the title for any such review.
However, it should be noted that, after a preliminary assessment of the regulations listed for RFA review, it may be found that the regulations, in fact, do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, and a full RFA review will be unnecessary.
Economic Assessment/Evaluation DOT requires an economic analysis for all its rulemakings.
A preliminary and final economic assessment (similar to what used to be identified as a ``Regulatory Impact Analysis'') is required for each proposed and final regulation, respectively, that is likely to be very costly.
For other rulemakings, a regulatory evaluation is prepared.
Definitions The agenda covers all rules and regulations of the Department, including those that establish conditions for financial assistance.
The following definitions are provided for ease in understanding the information in this document.
Initiating office means an operating administration or other organizational element within the Department that formulates regulations.
Significant rulemaking is now being referred to in this agenda as an agency priority.
This means a rulemaking that is very costly, controversial, or of substantial public interest; would have a major impact on another Federal agency; would have a substantial effect on State and/or local or tribal governments; would have a substantial impact on a major transportation safety problem; would initiate a substantial regulatory program or change in policy; would be substantially different from international requirements or standards; would materially alter budgetary impacts; or otherwise involves important legal or policy issues.
Office of Management and Budget (OMB)/Secretarial Review Any rulemaking document OMB identifies as significant is subject to its review and will be classified as significant by DOT.
A few rulemakings identified as agency priority by DOT, but not significant by OMB, and some rulemaking documents (e.g., extensions of compliance dates), although part of
an otherwise significant rulemaking, are not subject to OMB review.
All DOT agency priority rulemaking documents are subject to review by the Secretary of Transportation.
Explanation of Information on the Agenda The format for this agenda is required by Office of Management and Budget memorandum of June 10, 1997.
First, the agenda is divided by initiating offices.
Then, in accordance with the OMB memorandum, for each initiating office, the agenda is divided into five categories: (1) Prerule stage, (2) proposed rule stage, (3) final rule stage, (4) long-term actions, and (5) completed actions.
For each entry, the agenda provides the following information: (1) The ``significance'' of the action; (2) a short descriptive title; (3) the legal basis for the action being taken or the regulation being reviewed; (4) the related regulatory citation in the Code of Federal Regulations; (5) an indication of any legal deadline and, if so, for what type of action (e.g., NPRM, final rule); (6) an abstract of the review or the proposed or final regulation; (7) a timetable, including the earliest expected date for a decision, on whether to issue the proposed or final regulation or complete the review and determine the corrective action to be taken.
(The action taken can be revocation or revision of the regulation, or it can be a determination that no regulatory action is necessary because the regulation is found to be achieving its goals and the goals and objectives of Executive Order 12866 and the Department's Regulatory Policies and Procedures.); (8) an indication as to whether the rulemaking will affect small entities and/or levels of government and which categories of small entities or governments will be impacted; (9) if there is information that does not fit in the other categories, it will be included under a separate heading entitled ``Additional Information'' (which will also note any differences between OMB's ``significant'' and DOT's ``agency priority'' classification); (10) a listing, where determined, of any analyses an initiating office will prepare or has prepared for the rulemaking document; e.g., an Economic Assessment, an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), or a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis; (11) an agency contact office or official who can provide further information, including advice on how to obtain
documents referenced in the agenda; (12) a Regulation Identifier Number (RIN) assigned to identify an individual rulemaking in the agenda and facilitate tracing further action on the issue in the Federal Register that may occur between agenda publications; (13) an indication of whether the item is part of the Reinventing Government effort and, if so, whether it would revise existing text in the Code of Federal Regulations or eliminate text; (14) an indication if the action is subject to the Unfunded Mandates Act; and (15) an indication if the action is major under the congressional review of rulemaking procedures established by the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act.
For nonsignificant regulations issued routinely and frequently as a part of an established body of technical requirements (such as the Federal Aviation Administration's Airspace Rules), to keep those requirements operationally current, only the general category of the regulations, the identity of a contact office or official, and an indication of the expected number of regulations are included; individual regulations are not listed.
If a regulatory docket number has already been established, it may be provided under the ``Additional Information'' heading.
If a member of the public desires further information regarding a particular proposal or regulation, reference should be made to this docket number.
In the ``Timetable'' column, abbreviations are used to indicate the particular documents being considered for issuance by that date.
ANPRM stands for Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, SNPRM for Supplemental Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, NPRM for Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, and FR for Final Rule.
Listing a future date in this column is not an indication that a proposed or a final rule will be issued on that date; it is the earliest date on which a decision is expected to be made on whether to issue the document listed.
Submittal of any proposed or final rule to the Office of Management and Budget for review under Executive Order 12866 must follow such a decision.
If any document is issued, publication in the Federal Register would follow within a few days of completion of this review.
In addition, these dates are based on current schedules.

subsequent to the issuance of this agenda could result in a decision not to take regulatory action or in changes to proposed publication dates.
For example, the need for further evaluation could result in a later publication date; evidence of a greater need for the regulation could result in an earlier publication date.
Finally, a dot () preceding an entry indicates that the entry appears in the agenda for the first time.
Request for Comments Our agenda is intended primarily for the use of the public.
Since its inception, we have made modifications and refinements that we believe provide the public with more helpful information, as well as make the agenda easier to use.
We would like you, the public, to make suggestions or comments on how the agenda could be further improved.
In an effort to comply further with the spirit of Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act, we are also seeking suggestions on which existing regulations issued by an operating administration of the Department or the Office of the Secretary you believe need to be reviewed to determine whether they should be revised or revoked.
The Department is particularly interested in obtaining information on requirements that have a ``significant economic impact on small entities'' and, therefore, must be reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
If you have any suggested regulations, please send them, along with your explanation of why they should be reviewed, to the concerned operating administration or the Office of the Secretary.
Purpose The Department is publishing this regulatory agenda in the Federal Register to share with interested members of the public the Department's preliminary expectations regarding its future regulatory actions.
This should enable the public to be more aware of the Department's regulatory activity.
Knowledge of the nature and scope of this activity, as well as the specific proposals and reviews being considered, should result in more effective public participation in the Department's regulatory activity.
For example, awareness of the dates when notices may be issued seeking public comment should allow appropriate planning and more efficient use of the comment
period.
By providing the expected date for a decision on whether to issue a final rule, the Department expects that more appropriate planning by those concerned with the regulation will also be possible.
This publication in the Federal Register does not impose any binding obligation on the Department or any of the offices within the Department with regard to any specific item on the agenda.
Regulatory action, in addition to the items listed, is not precluded.
If further information is desired on any of the items listed in the agenda, the public is encouraged to contact the individual listed for the particular item.
Additional information concerning the agenda in general or the Department's Regulatory Policies and Procedures may be obtained from Neil R. Eisner, whose address and telephone number appear above.
