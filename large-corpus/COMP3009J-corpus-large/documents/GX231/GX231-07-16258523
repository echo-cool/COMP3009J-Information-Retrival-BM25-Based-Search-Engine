WAIVERS A waiver of all or part of the special registration requirement(s) for up to one year may be requested in writing.
There is no form to request a waiver; a letter is sufficient.
Examples of the circumstances that might warrant a waiver includes, but is not limited to: a representative of a foreign government who was issued a visitor's visa in lieu of a diplomatic visa, an individual who should be exempt from special registration but was registered in error (such as an individual traveling with a diplomat's visa), or emergent medical circumstances (such as those requiring hospitalization) during the interview period.
If the waiver is not approved in writing before the interview period, or your departure, you s hould appear for the interview or report to the port -of-departure office.
All waiver requests should be send to the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection.
(CBP) A list of addresses for the CBP Field Offices is attached.
The CBP will only adjudicate requests that include relief from arrival and/or departure registration.
Please provide a detailed description of the relief that you are seeking, your name, date -of-birth, Fingerprint Identification Number, a 1'x1' passport style photograph, and any documents that support your application.
For example, if you are a crewmember seeking relief from registration upon arrival, in addition to the items referenced above, please provide a letter from your employer that indicates your need for a waiver, job status, and the frequency of entry.
If your waiver is approved you may have to report for an interview before a CBP officer and you may be required to provide your fingerprints.
