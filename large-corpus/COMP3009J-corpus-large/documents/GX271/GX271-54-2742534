After all, they had three older birth children.
Not only that, both had full-time jobs.
The seed was planted years ago when Miriam worked as a patient care assistant at a local hospital.
"People told me I would be a good foster parent."
Miriam left her position at the hospital to become a special education teacher at an elementary school.
"One day, a little boy came into the classroom.
He was from a group home, so I knew he didn't live with parents.
I fell in love with him, and I just couldn't let this boy get away from me," Miriam said.
Her first thought was to become a foster parent.
When Miriam inquired, she discovered that the eight-year-old really needed a permanent family.
"I was sort of scared.
I thought, `That's a big step.'"
Nevertheless, she mentioned it to Rick, who was more reluctant than his wife to pursue adoption.
After some discussion, they decided to adopt.
Whatever fears they had were conquered by love.
"It's the great unknown.
At first, you don't know how you're really going to respond.
But then you begin to see the laughter and playfulness, you see the child's personality, and your reservations melt away," said Rick.
What further helped Rick bond to his new son was the fact that he grew up in a group home.
"I know what it feels like," Rick said.
Rick and Miriam's birth children ages 14, 18 and 21 adjusted "fairly smoothly" to their new brother.
"At first, our youngest felt a little cheated.
But now she is a big sister," said Rick, something his youngest daughter has come to appreciate and enjoy.
The family now is in the process of adopting another young man, age 10, even though Miriam is completing work on a master's degree in special education and Rick holds two jobs one as a pastor and the other as a biomedical technician at a local hospital.
"If you have a home, why not offer it to someone else.
What's the point of living if you can't help someone else," said Miriam.
Rick agreed, adding, "When you give of yourself, you can never go wrong," he said.
4 Adoption Basics What is adoption? Adoption is a legal process that creates a lifelong not biologically related.
The adoption of a child is receive an adoption decree and birth certificate, member with all the rights and privileges of a birth relationship between a parent and child who are approved by the court and adoptive parents will acknowleding that the child is a legal family child.
Who Are The Children Available For Adoption? In Ohio there are currently more than 3,500 children waiting to be adopted.
Most of the children are: Z African American or older Caucasian children Z school-age children, many are teens Z part of a sibling group who would like to be placed together in the same home This chart explains how many children were waiting for adoption over the last 5 years.
5 The majority of children waiting for adoption in 2002 were between the ages of 10-17 years old.
The majority of children available for adoption in the year 2002 were boys.
The majority of children waiting for adoption in the year 2002 were African American children.
6 Meeting Adoptive Families - "A Heaping Houseful of Love" It was a moment that caught Cheri by surprise an innocent party prize at her church Christmas celebration to the family with the most children.
"When we won," she recalls, "I cried."
These were tears of happiness because there was a time when she and her husband, Ray, didn't know whether they would have children at all.
That question was answered from 1975 to 1986, when they adopted Christopher, Brian, Angie and Chase children, now 27, 23, 21 and 16 respectively.
Their quest wasn't over, however.
Cheri still felt a "yearning" to open her heart and home to more children.
So, in 1998, she and her husband, now in their 50s, more than doubled their number of children by adopting a sibling group of five.
"I never did plan to adopt five children at once," said Cheri, explaining that at first they wanted just one boy.
Then they considered twins.
As these matches didn't work out, the adoption workers included sibling groups as options.
"They were priming us to adopt more than a couple of children."
The newest additions to their family are Michael, 13; Ashley, 12; Kit, 10; Brittany, 8; and Jay, 6.
The addition of a sibling group, especially one this large, has both practical and emotional consequences.
"I wish we had is a bigger house with more bedrooms.
Throwing three kids into one room is too many," said Ray.
They are doing what they can by renovating their house to make it work better for a larger family.
Food demands also have increased significantly.
"We have what you might call `extensive' food storage," added Cheri, for instance, buying oatmeal in 40 lb. bags instead of grocery shelf sized containers.
Another significant issue was blending the new children into the family.
For instance, "As a 12-yearold, Chase had to deal with new brothers.
At night, Ray and I would go to our bedroom but Chase could never get away from them because he had to share everything."
To complicate matters, Michael was no longer the oldest child in the family, which was a difficult adjustment for him, said Cheri, adding that a certain amount of conflict was unavoidable before the children sorted out their places within the family.
Anyone who adopts siblings should be prepared for hard work, lots of demands and conflict.
However, whatever difficulties were associated with adopting such a large number of children have been offset by the rewards, she said.
"We have so much fun.
The kids always have someone to play with, and they are so friendly and outgoing.
We make friends everywhere we go," she said.
"This is the way it usually is: active, happy and excitable."
7 Who Can Adopt? There are all kinds of adoptive families.
The most important requirement for adoption is that the family can provide a loving, stable, and secure family for a growing child.
Adoptive families can be: Z married, single, divorced or widowed Z may or may not have other children Z at least 18 years old Z renters or home owners Z of a minimum yet stable income Z of no minimum education Is Adoption Right For Your Family? Adoption is a decision for the entire family.
It requires all family members to talk about what adoption might be like and how adopting a child (ren) will affect the family's current structure.
Since most of Ohio's waiting children are in foster care and are often times adopted by their foster parents, your family may want to speak with others who have adopted children from the foster care system.
Your family may also want to consider becoming foster parents.
Families thinking about becoming an adoptive/foster family should also consider available community resources that may support their decision to adopt and/or foster a child.
A list of adoption support groups within your community is located in the back of this guidebook on page 26.
Building Families Through Adoption "Family" offers all of us a chance to grow as humans; to reach our greatest potential.
Becoming a parent can bring out the best in us.
The need to care for and nurture another human, especially a child, is a stong human emotion and impulse.
On any given day over 22,000 children in Ohio are living with foster families or in another out-of home placement setting.
Over 3,500 children have had their biological parent's rights terminated and are currently residing in foster care settings as they wait for an adoptive family.
These children, who reside in the custody of local children service agencies, may be currently dealing with issues of past abuse, neglect, and / or dependency.
These children need families available to them through adoption.
Each year in Ohio, more and more children become legally free for adoption than Ohio agencies are able to place.
Each year, more and more faces of these children turn to us looking for an answer.
We hope that you want to become an adoptive parent.
But, if you decide that adoption is not right for your family, you can still be an important part in the mission to find families for Ohio's waiting children.

21 Meet Adoptive Families - "Go With Your Heart" For Robin and her husband, Howard, having a big family was always in the cards.
She grew up with seven siblings and he with three.
"I've always been a kid person, and he's been right there with me."
After having two birth children, they decided to jump start the process nine years ago by providing foster care.
Even so, taking the next step to adoption was not in their plan.
"We never considered adoption.
We assumed it would require big money.
Financially, we thought adoption was out of our league," said Robin.
Through their foster care experience, however, they learned that it costs nothing to adopt children who are in the custody of the county.
Not only that, the children receive a medical card and subsidies to take care of other needs.
"Once we found that out, we definitely started looking into adoption."
Exactly one week before Christmas in 2000, they adopted Angel, now 15, and Brittany, now four.
They also are fostering Angel's 17-year-old brother, Michael.
What's more, they have four more adoptions pending a sibling group of three and a young child with a significant physical disability.
Along the way, they've faced issues including the prospect of raising children with behavioral or physical challenges, the adoption of biracial children and being a middle-class family with limited resources.
"At first I was scared.
Now, it doesn't matter.
You learn to manage," Robin said.
Howard agreed, adding, "Yes, we've had some negative experiences, but the positives far outweigh the negatives."
This growing family manages just fine with a five-bedroom rental house, a 15-seat van and good stewardship of their financial resources.
"We do plenty of bargain shopping.
And when we go on vacations, we do a lot of things that are free," said Robin.
"Because our parents did not do much with us, we want to create a lot of lasting memories for our children."
One thing is certain: This is a family in every sense of the word.
"Some people say we're crazy.
Some say we're saints.
But we're a team in everything we do," said Howard.
After considering the challenges and rewards associated with adoption, they offer this simple advice to those thinking about adoption: "You've got to go with your heart."
22 Common Adoption Terms Adoption: The creation, by a court, of parental rights and responsibilities between a child and an adult or adult couple.
Adoption agency: Entity that provides one or more of the following services: home study services for potential adoptive parents, counseling for birth parents, placement services for children in need of adoption, post placement/prelegalization services and post legalization/finalization services.
In Ohio, these agencies must be licensed by the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services.
Adoption Assistance programs: (Title IV-E/federal) Created by the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980, this program provides federal financial support for children who are described as having special needs who are adopted.
In addition to a monthly money payment, children who are "IV-E eligible" are entitled to a state medical card and certain services under the federal Title XX program.
(See State Adoption Subsidy for information on state financial programs.)
Adoption exchange: An organized way for "waiting children" to be listed along with "waiting families" with the goal of making matches between the children and families.
There exist local, regional, statewide and national exchanges designed for this purpose.
The primary goal of the exchange is to assure that a permanent home is identified for a child as quickly as possible.
(See OAPL.)
Adoption Registry: Once a person whose adoption was legalized in Ohio reaches adulthood, they may sign up with this registry (which is maintained by the Ohio Department of Health) requesting identifying information about their birth family.
If that adopted person's birth family member also registers requesting a match, the next steps can occur.
It is called a mutual consent registry because both the adopted person and the birth family member must file requests prior to anything happening.
If both do contact the registry, a multi-step process occurs.
The probate court in the county where the adoption was finalized will decide if the Department of Health can connect the individuals filing matching registrations.
For more information about this registry call (614) 644-5635.
Adoption triad: The three primary persons affected by the adoption: the birth parents, the child and the adoptive parent(s).
Attachment: An emotional bond between two people that lasts over a long period of time sets up a relationship and helps each person reach their potential and feel both secure and connected.
Birth parent: Also called biological parent.
The term used for the two persons who genetically created a child.
These two persons have rights and responsibilities defined by law and the Constitution of the United States.
Closed adoption: An adoption in which all of one triad member's identifying information is concealed from all other triad members.
Facilitator: A doctor, attorney, minister, or other individual who informally aids or promotes an adoption by making a person seeking to adopt a minor aware of a child who is, or will be, available for adoption.
Finalization: (See legalization) Foster-Adopt placement: Definition varies somewhat from community to community but, in general, this term is used to describe legal risk placements (see definition below) and/or the adoption by foster parents of a child, currently placed in their home, whose initial plan was reunification with birth parents, whose plan has now, after diligent attempts at reunification have failed, been changed to the goal of adoption.
In case, the child, or children, is in foster care status upon entering the caregiver's home.
The caregiver is a licensed foster parent who also has completed an approved adoption home study process or is in the process of this home study.
In Ohio, many agencies offer a combined home study process designed in a way that the applicant becomes a licensed foster parent and is also approved to adopt at the end of the process.
Guardian ad litem: A person, sometimes an attorney, appointed by the court to make sure that the child's best interests are addressed in court hearings and other proceedings.
23 Home study: A process by which a potential adoptive parent educates themselves about the challenges and rewards offered through parenting an adopted child.
The process by which a potential adopter, with the assistance and guidance of an adoption agency, assesses their own skills, life experiences and strengths to determine the type of adoptive child they could best parent.
Identifying information: Information such as name, address, place of employment, Social Security number, etc., which could significantly assist one individual in locating another individual.
Independent adoption: An adoption facilitated by an attorney.
Interstate adoption: The adoptive placement of a child (or children) who is a resident of one state with an adoptive parent (or parents) who is a legal resident of a different state.
ICPC: The Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children.
An agreement enacted in all fifty states which coordinates most types of placements of children across state lines.
This includes, but is not limited to, the adoptive placement of children.
The Compact guarantees that each state's laws and procedures are met and the child's placement is supervised according to state laws and proper court procedures are followed.
Legalization : (Also called finalization) The legal act that establishes a family connection between the adopting person and the adopted person.
Usually done in a courtroom setting, this act grants rights and responsibilities to the adoptive parent and child equal to those rights and responsibilities granted to families created by birth.
Legally free for adoption: A child is legally free when the parental rights of both birth parents have been terminated and the time period for the birth parents to appeal the decision is over.
Legal risk placement: A placement of a child with a family who is interested in adopting the child, however the child placed is not legally free.
The placement family is usually both a certified foster family and an approved adoptive home.
The risk is that the birth parent's rights may not be terminated and the court may order the child be returned to the birth parent or a suitable birth relative.
The benefit is that this type of placement decreases the number of different placements a child may have.
Lifebook: A chronological record of a child's life, usually in a photo album or binder, created by the child and/or the caregivers, that documents for the child, in concrete ways, the events and relationships important to the child.
It may include photographs, mementos, descriptions, etc. that help the child understand their biological origins and others who have played a significant role in their life.
Loss: The emotional and psychological state experienced when someone temporarily or permanently is separated from someone or something to which they have an emotional attachment or need.
All loss causes trauma and crisis, though degree varies.
Medicaid: A type of medical insurance provided through the state, using combined federal and state funds, which most children who are considered to have special needs are entitled to receive.
This can be used in conjunction with the adoptive family's medical insurance to meet the child's needs.
Multiethnic Placement Act (MEPA): Sometimes now called "Removal of Barriers to Interethnic Placement," this is a federal law enacted in 1994, and amended in 1996, which prohibits an adoption agency from delaying or denying the placement of any child on the basis of race, color or national origin.
Non-recurring costs: One time expenses incurred by a person adopting a child, such as travel costs, legal costs, and home study-related costs.
These are frequently reimbursable through federal and local funds when adopting a waiting child.
OAPL - Ohio Adoption Photo Listing: Photos and descriptions of children throughout Ohio who are legally free and waiting for adoption.
Approved and waiting Ohio families may also be photo listed.
24 Open adoption/Openness: A wide continuum of options within adoption which recognizes the child's connection to both the birth family and adoptive family; usually an agreement made by the adults involved that can range from the sharing of only very basic information, to exchange of information through a third party to total information sharing and/or ongoing contact.
In Ohio these agreements are legal but non-binding.
Parent support groups: Formal or informal groups of adoptive parents and potential adoptive parents coming together to share information and resources.
They often also offer friendship, emotional support and recreational activities for adoptive family members.
Support groups form for a variety of reasons, usually based on a shared interest or characteristic.
Support groups can vary greatly from each other.
PASSS: Post Adoption Special Services Subsidy.
Unique to Ohio, this fund is available to any Ohio family who adopts or any family who adopts a child in the custody of an Ohio agency.
Eligible are families in which the child who, after the adoption is legalized, develops needs related to preexisting conditions or related to the adoption process itself.
Each county is given state funds to pay for specialized services to adoptive families who apply.
Ohio families who adopt a child from another state or country are eligible for this program.
Photo listings: Published photographs and descriptions of waiting children and/or waiting approved adopters that are used by agencies and individuals to identify potential matches.
Often an adoption exchange will publish a photo listing.
(See OAPL - Ohio Adoption Photo Listing).
Post legalization services: (Also called post-legal adoptive services) A variety of services offered to adoptive families after the child in the home has had their adoption legalized.
Many of these services are community-based, and may be formal or informal in nature.
This includes such things as ongoing educational opportunities to learn about adoption issues, counseling, respite care, and special medical services.
Putative Father Registry: A mechanism designed to allow birth fathers to identify themselves for the purpose of establishing their legal right to notification should an adoptive plan be under consideration for their child.
Respite care: The assuming of care giving duties for an individual (child) on a temporary basis, usually by a non-family member, designed to give the primary caregiver (parent) a break from the stress of direct care of the child.
Special needs: The term used in regard to a child waiting for adoption for whom identifying an adoptive home may be difficult.
State adoption subsidy: In Ohio, special services, a medical card and/or financial support are available to assist families who adopt children defined as having special needs.
These are negotiated on an individual basis based on the child and adoptive family's unique situation.
These subsidies are frequently used if a child with special needs is ineligible for the federal Adoption Assistance program.
Surrender: (Also known as relinquishment) The voluntary termination of parental rights by a birth parent.
Termination of parental rights: The legal severing of ties between a birth parent and their child.
These parental rights and responsibilities may be voluntary surrendered by the birth parent or, if the birth parent is proven unable to meet the child's long-term needs, may by severed involuntarily through the court system.

Children don't need perfect parents, just one or two individuals willing to meet the unique challenges of parenting and make a lifetime commitment to caring for and nurturing their children.
One of the advantages of special needs adoption is that almost any responsible adult can become an adoptive parent.
However, it is important for prospective parents to possess important personal characteristics such as: Z a belief in adoption and an ability to commit; Z patience and perseverance; Z a good sense of humor and talent for keeping life in perspective; Z a love of children and parenting; Z the ability to roll with unexpected changes, stresses, and challenges; Z the ability to deal with rejection without taking it personally; Z the ability to accept without judging; Z tolerance and understanding for your child's conflicting feelings and your own; Z an awareness that healing doesn't come quickly, all wounds cannot be healed, and your child may not attach to your family; Z the strength to be consistent and set limits; Z a willingness to learn new parenting techniques and advocate for your children's educational and medical needs; and Z resourcefulness.
8 If you have all or most of those qualities, then ask yourself these questions: Z Do I clearly understand why I want to adopt? Z If applicable--Do my partner and I work as a team? Are we both committed to adoption? Z Does my lifestyle allow me the time necessary to meet the needs of a special child? Think carefully about your answers to these questions.
You may decide to pursue a different type of adoption, investigate foster care, or realize that adoption really is not for you.
Take the time to make a good decision, because it is a decision you and your adoptive child will live with for life.
In addition, before seriously contemplating special needs adoption, prospective parents must honestly evaluate their desire and ability to successfully parent children who have troubling pasts and uncertain futures.
Many children who become available for adoption at older ages have not received the early care that kids need to develop a strong sense of security, trust, and self-esteem.
Many also suffer from conditions caused by past trauma, or prenatal exposure to alcohol or drugs.
Children whose backgrounds include traumatic experiences, abuse, and/or neglect may exhibit symptoms of distress such as: Z aggressiveness Z attachment disorders Z attention deficits and hyperactivity Z bed wetting Z defiance ZÃ¯Â¿Â½ depression Z impulsiveness Z learning disabilities Z low self-esteem Z lying Z poor peer relationships/social skills Fortunately, through therapy, medication, and consistent care, children can also find ways to overcome or at least better cope with many of these challenges.
Most children put their new adoptive parents through a period of testing to see if the parents are truly committed or just waiting for an excuse to desert the child as others have done before.
To improve your chances of successfully adopting a child who has special needs, be prepared to offer a home environment that combines extra love, support, and attention with clear structure and consistent limit-setting.
Parents should also be ready to actively advocate for their child at school, with peers, and within the community.
It can be immensely helpful for parents to have a support network or belong to an adoptive parent support group.

9 Researching Adoption Agencies This guidebook does not discuss infant adoptions, adoptions using private attorneys, or international adoptions.
The guidebook does however discuss the process of adoption through the use of a Public Children Services Agency (PCSA) or a Private Child Placing Agency (PCPA) that often works with public agencies in completing domestic adoptions.
If you are interested in completing an infant or international adoption, a list of current Ohio licensed agencies are located in the back of this guidebook starting on page (#).
Choosing an Adoption Agency Many of the waiting children available for adoption within PCSA are classified as children with special needs.
Special Needs is a phrase used to classify children who have a harder time finding families willing to adopt them.
The phrase special needs is used to describe factors such as: Z age Z background Z physical, mental and emotional challenges sometimes found among adoptable children Z children that are part of a sibling group that is being placed for adoption together Z children who are members of a minority group.
The first step in starting the adoption process is to contact your local Public Children Services Agency (PCSA).
Each county has its own PCSA.
There is a list of contact information for the 88 county agencies on page (####) in the back of this guidebook.
Questions to Ask When Researching Agencies When you call the agency of your choice, the staff will ask you brief questions about whether you are interested in becoming a foster and/or adoptive parent.
Because many of Ohio's foster parents adopt children in their care, you can be licensed as a foster parent and approved as an adoptive parent in one process.
Questions you may want to ask the agency as you make the choice of which agency to work with include: Z How many children and what type of children has the agency placed in the past few years? Z How many children does the agency have legally available for adoption? Z What are the characteristics of those children? Z How does the agency work with other public and private agencies both in Ohio and outside Ohio? Z How long, on average, must one wait for a child? Z What is the time lapse between application and placement? Z What are the agency's policies concerning adoption paperwork, educational classes and visits? Z Are adoption subsidies available and how do I apply for adoption subsidies? Z What are the agency's home study requirements and how do I start a homestudy? Z Have any of the agency's adoptions disrupted in the past five years? How does the agency prevent adoption disruptions? Z What is the agency's policy toward applicants who do not accept the first child offered to them? Z What services, including parenting classes, support groups, activities, access to therapy and counseling, and respite care, will the agency provide before and after the child is placed in your home? Z Can the agency provide references from parents who recently adopted from the agency? 10 Meet Adoptive Families Love Doesn't Cost a Dime Pat need only look to her own childhood to feel a passion for adoption.
In spite of a very difficult childhood, she was one of the lucky ones able to get an education, start a good career and turn her life around.
Out of her experience grew a passion for children in need, which moved her to first foster and then adopt.
"I believe in my heart that children deserve to be loved," she said.
"If I had given birth to all these children, it wouldn't make any difference."
"All these children" refers to three adopted children and numerous foster children over the years.
After her first adoption, she waited almost a decade before taking in two foster children, whom she subsequently helped to reunite with their birth father.
Then Pat fostered a five-year-old with behavioral challenges.
They soon bonded, and one day "he asked me what would happen to him if I didn't adopt him."
Soon, he became her second adopted child.
But the greatest challenge yet came when an agency approached her about taking a very special 12-year-old.
"When he was one, his brother threw a lighted match into his crib and he was burned over 85 percent of this body.
He has no right ear, no right hand and both feet are gone.
He can't hear or talk," she said.
"I was reluctant and very scared.
When he came, I was petrified," she recalled.
Then one day he reached out and pulled her close and "stole my heart right there...He has a personality that will steal your heart.
I can't imagine this child being with anyone but me.
I love him dearly.
My family loves him," she said.
The adoption was finalized in August, 2002.
Pat also has fostered another young lady who has turned 18 and has chosen to legally take Pat's last name in order to be a part of the family.
There are demands and sacrifices that come with adopting and fostering children, but Pat said the same is true of having birth children.
When confronted with children who have profound medical issues, her advice is, "Take it one day at a time."
For Pat, the rewards are worth it and, besides, "Love doesn't cost a dime."
11 The Adoption Process Attending Informational Meeting and Orientations Agencies will generally invite people who have expressed an interest in adopting a child to an informational meeting and/or orientation.
This meeting is designed to provide potential adoptive families with information about the home study process,
pre-service training, general information about the preplacement process and the finalization process.
The agency may also discuss supportive services available in the county.
Pre-Service Training You will be asked to participate in educational sessions in order to learn more about the children who are available for adoption as well as your strengths as an adoptive parent.
These educational sessions will explore adoption from a child's point of view as well as describe the needs of children found within the foster care system.
The training will help the adoptive applicant gain realistic expectations about adoption and gain confidence in the ability to parent a waiting child.
Topics discussed during pre-service include: Z The adoption process Z Child development Z Separation and loss that children experience Z Understanding behaviors and dealing with child behaviors and attachment Z Defining culture and diversity and cultural issues Z Adoption issues that relate to the child, birth family, and extended family Z Community resources and the importance of advocating The HomeStudy The homestudy is a process of education and self-evaluation.
It is a time for you and your caseworker to look at your readiness to adopt, as well as to identify special parenting abilities that you may offer to an adopted child.
The process allows the adoptive family to look at their family structure and their support system.
During the homestudy, adoptive parents will also explore their beliefs, attitudes and coping skills.
Your caseworker will meet with you and everyone living in your home to discuss the adoption process.
Through a series of group and individual meetings, you will learn more about the kind of children you might best parent.
Topics discussed during the homestudy include: Z Motivation for wanting to adopt Z Your life experiences and history Z Your marriage or relationship with a significant other person Z Your ability to support your family financially Z Your health Z Your support system When you complete the application for adoption, you will be assigned a caseworker who will work with your family to complete the homestudy process.
The homestudy process can take up to six months to complete, however many adoptive families may complete the homestudy process sooner.
During the homestudy process, certain documents are required to be viewed by your caseworker.
Such documents include: Z Physical examination of applicants and medical statements for household members Z Financial statement Z Verification of marriage or divorce 12 Verification of employment if you are employed Z Criminal background checks for household members over the age of 18 Z Safety audit of the home Families will receive notification when their homestudy has been completed and approved.
In homestudy approval, you will become eligible to register with the Ohio Adoption Photo Listing Families Waiting to Adopt Book.
This book is updated monthly and distributed to public children service agencies.
Social workers from children service agencies use this book when looking for potential families for waiting children.
In some cases when the agency is not able to approve a homestudy, the family can meet with the caseworker and if needed the agency, to discuss the reasons why the family was not approved and the possible alternative options for the family.
Z 13 Meet Adoptive Families "A Little Love and A Little Patience" Throughout life's twists and turns, Bill and Joyce never doubted there would be children in their lives.
The surprise was how many and from where they would come.
Theirs' is a true success story with a Hollywood happy ending.
It all started more than two decades ago, when the couple concluded they could not have birth children.
Shortly after they began to consider adoption, Joyce became pregnant with the first of two birth daughters.
Fast forward 15 years.
"Our daughters came up to us and said we should adopt because we were such good parents to them," recalls Bill.
He and Joyce knew they had more love to give, and they recognized a calling to open up their home to children in need.
First, they adopted a young girl, Camryn, about four years ago.
"Then the county asked us to provide respite care for two kids.
We found out that they lived right down the street in foster care," says Bill.
Soon, he and his wife initiated the adoption of Jasmine and Austin, now 7 and 9, respectively.
They also intend to adopt the three-year-old brother of one of their adopted children; a seven-yearold girl; and two brothers, ages 9 and 10.
Also, they currently have five foster children living with them.
Bill and Joyce have had 31 adopted or foster children placed with them in the last five years.
Adopting an older child can be difficult.
"It's challenging," says Bill.
"How can we do it? It's the love we have for kids.
We want to make a difference in their lives," he says.
They also have a "deep faith," added Bill, who is a minister.
He said they were pleasantly surprised to find out that the state pays for the cost of adopting children in the custody of the counties, and that the state provides subsidies and a medical card for the adopted children up to the age of 18.
Bill and Joyce encourage others to consider adoption.
"I don't think I'm exceptional or my wife is exceptional.
All it takes is a little patience and a little love," he says.
14 Matching Children and Families Your caseworker and agency will take into account the characteristics of children that you can best parent and the characteristics of children your homestudy approves you for when considering placement matches for your family.
During a matching conference, adoption professionals consider the strengths, characteristics, and needs of a waiting child, and compare those with the strengths and characteristics of waiting families.
The length of time it takes to be matched with a child largely depends on the special characteristics of children that you are able to parent.
A family who demonstrates the ability to parent a child with many special needs, may not wait very long until a child is placed with them.
The Ohio Adoption PhotoListing Online Prospective adoptive families are encouraged to regularly view the Ohio Adoption Photo Listing (OAPL) located on-line at the AdoptOHIO Kids website at: http://www.state.oh.us/odjfs/oapl/ .
The website contains pictures and descriptions of waiting children in the custody of public children service agencies throughout Ohio.
The descriptions of the children are supplied by the child's social worker and are intentionally brief.
A fuller description of the child is available from the child's social worker to prospective adoptive families who have completed the homestudy process.
There are approximately 2,500 children listed in the OAPL book.
Families interested in adoption are strongly encouraged to read the narratives and look at the pictures of children found within the PhotoListing in order to gain an understanding of the types of children available for adoption in Ohio.
Additional Resources Prospective adoptive families are also encouraged to look at the Ohio Adoption Features Books.
The Features Books give prospective adoptive families a chance to discover some of Ohio's waiting children.
Each book highlights approximately 30 children that are currently available for adoption.
Frequently, adoption agencies may have Features Books available to give prospective adoptive families.
When Your Agency Matches a Child With Your Family When your caseworker has identified a child for your family, you will be contacted and the worker will share detailed information about the child's background.
Such background information will include all known non-identifying information on the child's: Z Birth parents and other relatives Z Medical, emotional, and psychological history Z Past and current known developmental issues Z School history if applicable Z Placement history Your caseworker will give you time to think about the information and will be able to assist you in making your decision to adopt the child.
Your caseworker will also recommend that you discuss the child's information with your pediatrician or other professionals whom you would like.
If you decide to proceed with the child, your caseworker will arrange a time for your family and the child to meet.
Prior to this meeting, the caseworker may share your Introduction to Your Family Book with the child if your agency has requested that your family complete this book.
This book, prepared by the prospective adoptive family, includes pictures and information about your family.
Many adoptive families choose to include pictures of family members, family pets, the child's room, and extended family members and friends.
The Introduction to your Family Book helps in the preparation for the child's first meeting with their potential adoptive family.
Before the first meeting, your caseworker will also help prepare you and your family.
The caseworker will give you and your family suggestions for who should be involved in the first meeting and what type of activities may be most comfortable for the child.
15 Following the first meeting, your caseworker will arrange for a series of additional pre-placement visits in order for the child and adoptive family to get to know one another.
Pre-placement visits will be discussed with the foster parents or facility where the child resides in order to ensure the visitation schedule is acceptable to all involved parties.
Prior to the placement, adoptive families will receive the Child Study Inventory which lists the child's interests, talents, traits, and social, medical and psycological history.
After the preplacement visits, the child will join your family in your home.
Placement of The Child Into An Adoptive Home Once the child is placed with your family, you become responsible for the child's care.
Your social worker will continue to visit with your family for a period of time after the adoptive placement.
These visits are designed to assist you in connecting your new family with services and to discuss potential issues that may arise.
After a minimum period of six months, your family will become eligible to petition the court to finalize the adoption.
16 Meet Adoptive Families - "Family Magic" Despite their number, Mark and Dennise's family operates like almost any other household.
Children gather in clusters doing homework, children gather in front of the television, pets move about, mom and dad help out wherever they are needed.
However, there is something different about this family because they are living a commitment made years ago.
When Mark and Dennise were studying to become nurses, they made a pledge to look into becoming foster parents.
"We knew there was a great need," explains Mark.
"We wanted to care for medically fragile children, since we were both nurses," adds Dennise.
They put the desire to help into action and were licensed as foster parents in 1997.
They are licensed through the House of Hope, an agency that works with children from eastern and northern Ohio.
To date, the couple has opened their home to more than 200 children.
As hoped, they have been able to provide care for medically fragile infants and toddlers.
The couple has opened their home to children with a wide variety of needs.
Today they also are adoptive parents, having expanded on their commitment to foster.
Melissa was the couple's first placement.
"She was placed for one night of respite and never left," says Dennise, laughingly.
Then, on National Adoption Day in November 2002, the family adopted three siblings ages 11, 13 and 17.
Mark and Dennise also have two birth children and two foster children.
The couple has always been open to helping however they are needed.
When children are able to return to their birth parents, the family celebrates the reunification.
When children become available for adoption, decisions are made by consensus.
The family also votes on foster care placements.
Mark and Dennise are extremely proud of the unselfishness displayed by the children.
Both Mark and Dennise state that they have received much more than they have given over the years.
"We have been opened to so many different religions and cultures," says Dennise.
"It has changed us a lot," explains Mark.
He adds, "you never know until you open your home.
Our friends and relatives have grown a lot, too."
17 The final steps to adoption The Legalization of an Adoption
Legalizing the adoption involves a short hearing at a probate court during which adoptive parents are granted permanent legal custody of their adopted child.
This legislative process finalizes the parent child relationship that is created.
Following the adoption hearing, adoptive parents will work with their caseworker and/or attorney to obtain the child's new birth certificate and final Decree of Adoption.
Post Finalization Services A variety of formal and informal services are available to members of the adoptive family, either as a group or as individuals.
Support groups, counseling, respite care, medical services, educational resources, and a variety of community resources may be available to help meet ongoing needs or new needs that may have surfaced after the adoption finalization.
Although types and locations of adoption services vary over time, you may always contact your child placing agency or any other adoption agency for assistance in locating adoption services in your area.
There is a list of current post adoption services located in the back of this guidebook on page (#####).
18 Financial Support That May Be Available to Adoptive Families Post Adoption Special Services Subsidy The Post Adoption Special Services Subsidy (PASSS) program is for all adoptive families in Ohio whose child may be experiencing adoption-related difficulties or issues that were preexisting but were not apparent at the time of adoption.
Such services are available to prevent the adoption from disrupting.
PASSS services may include: Z Medical services Z Psychological services Z Psychiatric services Z Counseling expense Z Residential treatment Z Surgical treatment For more information regarding the PASSS program, please contact your county's public children services agency.
Title IV-E Adoption Subsidy Title IV-E Federal Adoption Subsidy program, provides federal financial support for children placed for adoption who meet the eligibility criteria.
In order for a child to be eligible for Title IV-E adoption Assistance, a public children services agency must determine and document that: Z The child meets special needs status Z At the time the child came into custody of the public children services agency or private child placing agency and at the time adoption proceedings are initiated, the child would have been eligible for Aid to Dependent Children (ADC) or the child is determined eligible for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits by the Social Security Administration prior to the finalization of adoption In addition to a monthly monetary payment, these children are eligible for medical coverage under Medicaid and may be eligible to receive assistance and services under the federal Title XX program.
Applications for Title IV-E subsidy must be completed by the adoptive family prior to adoption finalization.
The amount of adoption assistance is determined by negotiation and mutual agreement between the adoptive parent(s) and the public children service agency.
For more information, please contact your county's public children service agency.
State Adoption Maintenance Subsidy Program The State Adoption Maintenance Subsidy Program is a financial program which provides monthly maintenance subsidy payments to adoptive families adopting children who meet the special needs criteria that is defined in the Ohio Administrative Code rules and who are not eligible for Title IV-E adoption assistance.
The public children services agency in your county is responsible for administering and determining the eligibility for the State Adoption Subsidy Program.
Applications must be completed by the adoptive family prior to finalization.
The family's income is taken into consideration when determining eligibility for the State Maintenance Subsidy.
The child may also be eligible for medical coverage under Medicaid.
Contact your adoption caseworker to learn more about obtaining the State Adoption Subsidy Program.
Non-Recurring Adoption Expense Subsidy The Non-Recurring Adoption Expense is designed to promote the adoption of special needs children by providing eligible families the opportunity for reimbursement of certain costs related to adopting a child with special needs.
Non-recurring adoption expenses are those one-time expenses directly 19 related to the legal adoption of a child with special needs.
The program provides reimbursement, up to $2,000, for expenses such as supervision of placements prior to the adoption, attorney's fees, court costs, transportation costs, and the reasonable costs of lodging and foods.
Reimbursement is also available for costs associated with the adoption homestudy, and reasonable and necessary adoption fees.
The adoptive family's income is not taken into consideration in determining whether payments for non-recurring expenses should be paid.
Applications and agreements for the NonRecurring Adoption Expense Subsidy must be completed by the adoptive family prior to adoption finalization.
Adoption Tax Benefits The federal government and the state of Ohio allow families who adopt to receive a non-refundable tax credit for the year in which the adoption was legalized.
Many foster and adoptive parents are eligible for tax benefits.
The Hope for Children Act (Public Law 107-16) increases the previous $5,000 adoption tax credit to $10,000.
All adoptive parents should meet with a tax advisor to discuss tax benefits (Application forms are available through the IRS and the State Treasurer's Office).
Building Families Through Adoption "Family" offers all of us a chance to grow as humans; to reach our greatest potential.
Becoming a parent can bring out the best in us.
The need to care for and nurture another human, especially a child, is a stong human emotion and impulse.
On any given day over 22,000 children in Ohio are living with foster families or in another out-of home placement setting.
Over 3,500 children have had their biological parent's rights terminated and are currently residing in foster care settings as they wait for an adoptive family.
These children, who reside in the custody of local children service agencies, may be currently dealing with issues of past abuse, neglect, and / or dependency.
These children need families available to them through adoption.
Each year in Ohio, more and more children become legally free for adoption than Ohio agencies are able to place.
Each year, more and more faces of these children turn to us looking for an answer.
We hope that you want to become an adoptive parent.
But, if you decide that adoption is not right for your family, you can still be an important part in the mission to find families for Ohio's waiting children.

21 Meet Adoptive Families - "Go With Your Heart" For Robin and her husband, Howard, having a big family was always in the cards.
She grew up with seven siblings and he with three.
"I've always been a kid person, and he's been right there with me."
After having two birth children, they decided to jump start the process nine years ago by providing foster care.
Even so, taking the next step to adoption was not in their plan.
"We never considered adoption.
We assumed it would require big money.
Financially, we thought adoption was out of our league," said Robin.
Through their foster care experience, however, they learned that it costs nothing to adopt children who are in the custody of the county.
Not only that, the children receive a medical card and subsidies to take care of other needs.
"Once we found that out, we definitely started looking into adoption."
Exactly one week before Christmas in 2000, they adopted Angel, now 15, and Brittany, now four.
They also are fostering Angel's 17-year-old brother, Michael.
What's more, they have four more adoptions pending a sibling group of three and a young child with a significant physical disability.
Along the way, they've faced issues including the prospect of raising children with behavioral or physical challenges, the adoption of biracial children and being a middle-class family with limited resources.
"At first I was scared.
Now, it doesn't matter.
You learn to manage," Robin said.
Howard agreed, adding, "Yes, we've had some negative experiences, but the positives far outweigh the negatives."
This growing family manages just fine with a five-bedroom rental house, a 15-seat van and good stewardship of their financial resources.
"We do plenty of bargain shopping.
And when we go on vacations, we do a lot of things that are free," said Robin.
"Because our parents did not do much with us, we want to create a lot of lasting memories for our children."
One thing is certain: This is a family in every sense of the word.
"Some people say we're crazy.
Some say we're saints.
But we're a team in everything we do," said Howard.
After considering the challenges and rewards associated with adoption, they offer this simple advice to those thinking about adoption: "You've got to go with your heart."
22 Common Adoption Terms Adoption: The creation, by a court, of parental rights and responsibilities between a child and an adult or adult couple.
Adoption agency: Entity that provides one or more of the following services: home study services for potential adoptive parents, counseling for birth parents, placement services for children in need of adoption, post placement/prelegalization services and post legalization/finalization services.
In Ohio, these agencies must be licensed by the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services.
Adoption Assistance programs: (Title IV-E/federal) Created by the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980, this program provides federal financial support for children who are described as having special needs who are adopted.
In addition to a monthly money payment, children who are "IV-E eligible" are entitled to a state medical card and certain services under the federal Title XX program.
(See State Adoption Subsidy for information on state financial programs.)
Adoption exchange: An organized way for "waiting children" to be listed along with "waiting families" with the goal of making matches between the children and families.
There exist local, regional, statewide and national exchanges designed for this purpose.
The primary goal of the exchange is to assure that a permanent home is identified for a child as quickly as possible.
(See OAPL.)
Adoption Registry: Once a person whose adoption was legalized in Ohio reaches adulthood, they may sign up with this registry (which is maintained by the Ohio Department of Health) requesting identifying information about their birth family.
If that adopted person's birth family member also registers requesting a match, the next steps can occur.
It is called a mutual consent registry because both the adopted person and the birth family member must file requests prior to anything happening.
If both do contact the registry, a multi-step process occurs.
The probate court in the county where the adoption was finalized will decide if the Department of Health can connect the individuals filing matching registrations.
For more information about this registry call (614) 644-5635.
Adoption triad: The three primary persons affected by the adoption: the birth parents, the child and the adoptive parent(s).
Attachment: An emotional bond between two people that lasts over a long period of time sets up a relationship and helps each person reach their potential and feel both secure and connected.
Birth parent: Also called biological parent.
The term used for the two persons who genetically created a child.
These two persons have rights and responsibilities defined by law and the Constitution of the United States.
Closed adoption: An adoption in which all of one triad member's identifying information is concealed from all other triad members.
Facilitator: A doctor, attorney, minister, or other individual who informally aids or promotes an adoption by making a person seeking to adopt a minor aware of a child who is, or will be, available for adoption.
Finalization: (See legalization) Foster-Adopt placement: Definition varies somewhat from community to community but, in general, this term is used to describe legal risk placements (see definition below) and/or the adoption by foster parents of a child, currently placed in their home, whose initial plan was reunification with birth parents, whose plan has now, after diligent attempts at reunification have failed, been changed to the goal of adoption.
In case, the child, or children, is in foster care status upon entering the caregiver's home.
The caregiver is a licensed foster parent who also has completed an approved adoption home study process or is in the process of this home study.
In Ohio, many agencies offer a combined home study process designed in a way that the applicant becomes a licensed foster parent and is also approved to adopt at the end of the process.
Guardian ad litem: A person, sometimes an attorney, appointed by the court to make sure that the child's best interests are addressed in court hearings and other proceedings.
23 Home study: A process by which a potential adoptive parent educates themselves about the challenges and rewards offered through parenting an adopted child.
The process by which a potential adopter, with the assistance and guidance of an adoption agency, assesses their own skills, life experiences and strengths to determine the type of adoptive child they could best parent.
Identifying information: Information such as name, address, place of employment, Social Security number, etc., which could significantly assist one individual in locating another individual.
Independent adoption: An adoption facilitated by an attorney.
Interstate adoption: The adoptive placement of a child (or children) who is a resident of one state with an adoptive parent (or parents) who is a legal resident of a different state.
ICPC: The Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children.
An agreement enacted in all fifty states which coordinates most types of placements of children across state lines.
This includes, but is not limited to, the adoptive placement of children.
The Compact guarantees that each state's laws and procedures are met and the child's placement is supervised according to state laws and proper court procedures are followed.
Legalization : (Also called finalization) The legal act that establishes a family connection between the adopting person and the adopted person.
Usually done in a courtroom setting, this act grants rights and responsibilities to the adoptive parent and child equal to those rights and responsibilities granted to families created by birth.
Legally free for adoption: A child is legally free when the parental rights of both birth parents have been terminated and the time period for the birth parents to appeal the decision is over.
Legal risk placement: A placement of a child with a family who is interested in adopting the child, however the child placed is not legally free.
The placement family is usually both a certified foster family and an approved adoptive home.
The risk is that the birth parent's rights may not be terminated and the court may order the child be returned to the birth parent or a suitable birth relative.
The benefit is that this type of placement decreases the number of different placements a child may have.
Lifebook: A chronological record of a child's life, usually in a photo album or binder, created by the child and/or the caregivers, that documents for the child, in concrete ways, the events and relationships important to the child.
It may include photographs, mementos, descriptions, etc. that help the child understand their biological origins and others who have played a significant role in their life.
Loss: The emotional and psychological state experienced when someone temporarily or permanently is separated from someone or something to which they have an emotional attachment or need.
All loss causes trauma and crisis, though degree varies.
Medicaid: A type of medical insurance provided through the state, using combined federal and state funds, which most children who are considered to have special needs are entitled to receive.
This can be used in conjunction with the adoptive family's medical insurance to meet the child's needs.
Multiethnic Placement Act (MEPA): Sometimes now called "Removal of Barriers to Interethnic Placement," this is a federal law enacted in 1994, and amended in 1996, which prohibits an adoption agency from delaying or denying the placement of any child on the basis of race, color or national origin.
Non-recurring costs: One time expenses incurred by a person adopting a child, such as travel costs, legal costs, and home study-related costs.
These are frequently reimbursable through federal and local funds when adopting a waiting child.
OAPL - Ohio Adoption Photo Listing: Photos and descriptions of children throughout Ohio who are legally free and waiting for adoption.
Approved and waiting Ohio families may also be photo listed.
24 Open adoption/Openness: A wide continuum of options within adoption which recognizes the child's connection to both the birth family and adoptive family; usually an agreement made by the adults involved that can range from the sharing of only very basic information, to exchange of information through a third party to total information sharing and/or ongoing contact.
In Ohio these agreements are legal but non-binding.
Parent support groups: Formal or informal groups of adoptive parents and potential adoptive parents coming together to share information and resources.
They often also offer friendship, emotional support and recreational activities for adoptive family members.
Support groups form for a variety of reasons, usually based on a shared interest or characteristic.
Support groups can vary greatly from each other.
PASSS: Post Adoption Special Services Subsidy.
Unique to Ohio, this fund is available to any Ohio family who adopts or any family who adopts a child in the custody of an Ohio agency.
Eligible are families in which the child who, after the adoption is legalized, develops needs related to preexisting conditions or related to the adoption process itself.
Each county is given state funds to pay for specialized services to adoptive families who apply.
Ohio families who adopt a child from another state or country are eligible for this program.
Photo listings: Published photographs and descriptions of waiting children and/or waiting approved adopters that are used by agencies and individuals to identify potential matches.
Often an adoption exchange will publish a photo listing.
(See OAPL - Ohio Adoption Photo Listing).
Post legalization services: (Also called post-legal adoptive services) A variety of services offered to adoptive families after the child in the home has had their adoption legalized.
Many of these services are community-based, and may be formal or informal in nature.
This includes such things as ongoing educational opportunities to learn about adoption issues, counseling, respite care, and special medical services.
Putative Father Registry: A mechanism designed to allow birth fathers to identify themselves for the purpose of establishing their legal right to notification should an adoptive plan be under consideration for their child.
Respite care: The assuming of care giving duties for an individual (child) on a temporary basis, usually by a non-family member, designed to give the primary caregiver (parent) a break from the stress of direct care of the child.
Special needs: The term used in regard to a child waiting for adoption for whom identifying an adoptive home may be difficult.
State adoption subsidy: In Ohio, special services, a medical card and/or financial support are available to assist families who adopt children defined as having special needs.
These are negotiated on an individual basis based on the child and adoptive family's unique situation.
These subsidies are frequently used if a child with special needs is ineligible for the federal Adoption Assistance program.
Surrender: (Also known as relinquishment) The voluntary termination of parental rights by a birth parent.
Termination of parental rights: The legal severing of ties between a birth parent and their child.
These parental rights and responsibilities may be voluntary surrendered by the birth parent or, if the birth parent is proven unable to meet the child's long-term needs, may by severed involuntarily through the court system.
