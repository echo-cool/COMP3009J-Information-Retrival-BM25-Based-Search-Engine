In the Matter of
ZALE CORPORATION, a corporation.
DOCKET NO.
C-3738
DECISION AND ORDER
The Federal Trade Commission having initiated an investigation of certain acts and practices of the Respondent named in the caption hereof, and the Respondent having been furnished thereafter with a copy of a draft of the complaint that the San Francisco Regional Office proposed to present to the Commission for its consideration and which, if issued by the Commission, would charge the Respondent with violation of the Federal Trade Commission Act, and
The respondent, its attorneys, and counsel for the Commission having thereafter executed an agreement containing a consent order, an admission by the Respondent of all the jurisdictional facts set forth in the aforesaid draft of complaint, a statement that the signing of said agreement is for settlement purposes only and does not constitute an admission by the Respondent that the law has been violated as alleged in such complaint, or that the facts as alleged in such complaint, other than jurisdictional facts, are true, and waivers and other provisions as required by the Commission's Rules; and
The Commission having thereafter considered the matter and having determined that it had reason to believe that the Respondent has violated the said Act, and that a complaint should issue stating its charges in that respect, and having thereupon accepted the executed consent agreement and placed such agreement on the public record for a period of sixty (60) days, now in further conformity with the procedure prescribed in Section 2.34 of its Rules, the Commission hereby issues its complaint, makes the following jurisdictional findings and enters the following order:
1.
Respondent Zale Corporation is a Delaware corporation with its principal office or place of business at 901 W. Walnut Hill Lane, Irving, Texas 75038-1003.
2.
The Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction of the subject matter of this proceeding and of the Respondent, and the proceeding is in the public interest.

APPENDIX B
[To be printed on Zale Corporation letterhead]
[date]
Dear Zale employee:
This letter is to inform you that Zale Corporation recently settled a civil dispute with the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") regarding certain alleged claims for our "Ocean Treasures" line of imitation pearl jewelry.
We deny the FTC's allegations, but in order to avoid protracted litigation we have entered into a settlement agreement.
As part of that settlement, we are required to summarize the requirements of the settlement for our directors and officers, and for employees and others who sell our products to consumers.
The FTC alleged that Zale advertisements falsely claimed, expressly or by implication, that Ocean Treasures jewelry was composed of cultured pearls.
Our settlement with the FTC contains the following requirements:
1.
Zale may not represent that imitation pearls are cultured pearls.
2.
Zale may not represent that imitation pearl jewelry contains pearls unless we specifically describe the jewelry as "artificial," "imitation," "simulated," or with another word or phrase of like meaning.
3.
Zale may not represent that cultured pearl jewelry contains pearls unless we specifically describe the jewelry as "cultured" "cultivated," or with another word or phrase of like meaning.
4.
Zale may not misrepresent the composition or origin of any jewelry product composed partially or entirely of natural pearls, cultured pearls, or imitation pearls.
5.
Zale must make available to consumers for a period of three years, in each store that offers for sale natural pearl, cultured pearl, or imitation pearl jewelry, an information sheet that describes the difference among natural pearls, cultured pearls, and imitation pearls.
This information sheet, which we are providing to each store, must be made available in a place and manner that is calculated to attract the attention of consumers.
Requirements 1-4, above, apply to all representations made in advertising, labeling, promotion, offering for sale, sale and distribution, including individual sales transactions.
Thank you for your assistance.
If you have any questions about the requirements contained in this letter, please call .
Sincerely,
[Zale Official] [Title]
