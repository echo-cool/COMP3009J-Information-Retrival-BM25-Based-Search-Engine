Methodology
The Federal justice database Source of data The source of data for all tables in this Compendium is the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) Federal justice database.
The database is presently constructed from source files provided by the Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys, the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, the United States Sentencing Commission, and the U.S. Bureau of Prisons.
The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts also maintains the data collected by the Pretrial Services Administration, the U.S. Court of Appeals, and the U.S. Probation officer.
Federal law prohibits the use of these files for any purposes other than research or statistics.
A description of the source agency data files is provided in the table at the end of this section.
Some records in the Federal justice database are matched according to a statistically weighted combination of names, other personal identifiers, dates of court appearances, types of offenses, and other relevant information contained in the files.
Using the matched data files, it is possible to combine information about two or more stages of the processing of a criminal matter or case, for example from adjudication to probation or parole supervision.
Reporting period Wherever possible, matters or cases have been selected according to some event which occurred during fiscal year 1994 (October 1, 1993, through September 30, 1994).
Some data files provided by source agencies are organized according to a calendar year time frame; these have been combined and divided into fiscal years for purposes of the Compendium.
Files which are organized by their source agencies according to fiscal year nonetheless include some pertinent records in later years' files.
For example, tabulations of suspects in matters concluded during fiscal year 1994 in this Compendium have
been assembled from source files containing records of 1994 matters concluded which were entered into the data system during fiscal years 1994 or 1995.
Availability of data items The availability of particular items of information is affected by the data source.
For example, data on prosecutors' decisions prior to court filing are provided for cases investigated by U.S. attorneys, but not for those the U.S. Department of Justice.
Criminal Division cases enter the data base once they are filed in U.S. district court, however.
Many items of social and demographic information come from presentence investigation records, supervision records, or sentencing records, and are available only for arrested defendants who were convicted and/or began serving a sentence involving supervised release.
This particularly affects sex, race, ethnicity, and prior record information.
Data on offender characteristics in chapters 3 and 4 are limited to offenders convicted and sentenced pursuant to the Federal sentencing guidelines whose records have been reported to the U.S. Sentencing Commission.
Currently, it is estimated that more than 90% of the felony defendants convicted in U.S. district courts are sentenced pursuant to the Federal sentencing guidelines.
The Federal sentencing guidelines do not cover class B and C misdemeanors or infractions or traffic offenses occurring on Federal land.
Table construction and interpretation Unit of analysis The unit of analysis in chapters 1 through 5 is a combination of a person (or corporation) and a matter or case.
For example, if a single person
is involved in three different criminal cases during the time period specified in the table, he or she is counted three times in the tabulation.
Similarly, if a single criminal case involves a corporate defendant and four individual defendants, it counts five times in the tabulation.
In chapter 6, the unit of analysis for incarceration, probation, parole, or other supervised release is a person entering custody or supervision, or a person leaving custody or supervision.
For example, a person convicted in two concurrent cases and committed once to the custody of the U.S. Bureau of Prisons in the indicated time period is counted as one admission to a term of incarceration.
A person who terminates probation twice in the indicated time period, such as with a violation and again after reinstatement, is counted as two terminations of probation.
Interpretation The tables in the Compendium are constructed to permit the user to make valid comparisons of numbers within each table and to compare percentage rates across tables.
The total numbers of subjects in Compendium tables that are based on records linked between two files are generally less than the total number of records in either source file.
Accordingly, comparisons of absolute numbers across two or more tables in this volume and other data sources are not necessarily valid.
Offense classifications Procedure The offense classification procedure used in this Compendium is based on the classification system followed by the Administrative Office of the U.S.
*These categories correspond to the Bureau of Justice Statistics crime definitions and, to the extent possible, are organized and presented consistently with BJS publications on State criminal justice systems.
Methodology
89
Courts.
Specific offenses in the Administrative Office classification are combined to form the BJS categories shown in the Compendium tables.* For data from the Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys, which include United States Code citations but do not include the Administrative Office offense classifications, United States Code titles and sections are translated into the Administrative Office classification system and then aggregated into the offense categories used in the tables.
Offense categories for prisoners in chapter 6 are based on combinations of offense designations used by the Bureau of Prisons.
They are similar to the categories in other chapters and other tables in chapter 6, but may not be directly comparable.
Felony/misdemeanor distinctions Felony and misdemeanor distinctions are provided where possible.
Felony offenses are those with a maximum penalty of more than 1 year in prison.
Misdemeanor offenses are those with a maximum penalty of 1 year or less.
Felonies and misdemeanors are further classified using the maximum term of imprisonment authorized.
Section 3559, U.S. Code, Title 18 classifies offenses according to the following schedule: Felonies Class A felony -- life imprisonment, or if the maximum penalty is death.
Class B felony -- 25 years or more.
Class C felony -- less than 25 years but more than 10 years.
Class D felony -- less than 10 years but more than 5 years.
Class E felony -- less than 5 years but more than 1 year.
*These categories correspond to the Bureau of Justice Statistics crime definitions and, to the extent possible, are organized and presented consistently with BJS publications on State criminal justice systems.
Misdemeanors Class A misdemeanor -- 1 year or less but more than 1 months.
Class B misdemeanor -- 6 months or less but more than 30 days.
Class C misdemeanor -- 30 days or less but more than 5 days.
Infraction -- 5 days or less, or if no imprisonment is authorized.
In this Compendium, felony and misdemeanor distinctions are provided where the data permit these distinctions.
Chapter 1 does not use this distinction because many suspects cannot be so classified at the investigation stage in the criminal justice process.
Chapter 2 no longer reports this distinction because the Pretrial Services Agency no longer gathers this information.
Chapters 3 and 4 distinguish between felony and misdemeanor offenses, as do tables 6.1Â­6.6.
Tables 6.7Â­6.10 follow the convention of other BJS publications by separately tabulating offenders whose actual imposed sentences are less than or equal to 1 year and those whose actual sentences are greater than 1 year.
Most serious offense selection Where more than one offense is charged or adjudicated, the most serious offense (the one that may or did result in the most severe sentence) is used to classify offenses.
The offense description may change as the criminal justice process proceeds.
Tables indicate whether investigated, charged or adjudicated offenses are used.
In chapter 1, the most serious offense is based on the criminal lead charge as determined by the assistant U.S. attorney responsible for the criminal proceeding.
In chapter 2, the major charged offense is based upon the Administrative Office's offense severity classification system, as determined by the pretrial officer responsible for the case.
To select this offense, the officer ranks offenses according to severity based on maximum imprisonment, type of
crime, and maximum fines.
In chapters 3 and 4, the most serious offense charged is based on statutory maximum penalties.
In chapter 3, the most serious offense charged is the one that has the most severe potential sentence.
For chapter 4, conviction offenses are based on statutory maximum penalties.
In chapter 5, offenses are classified by the offense of conviction.
In tables 6.1Â­6.6, the most serious offense of conviction is either the one having the longest sentence imposed or, if equal sentences were imposed or there was no imprisonment, it was the offense carrying the highest severity code as determined by the Administrative Office's offense severity code ranking.
In tables 6.7Â­6.12, prisoners are classified according to the offense which bears the longest single incarceration sentence.
Offense categories For offense categories in all text tables, the following conditions apply: "Murder" includes nonnegligent manslaughter.
"Other sex offenses" may include some nonviolent offenses.
"Fraud" excludes tax fraud.
"Larceny" excludes transportation of stolen property.
"Other property felonies" excludes fraudulent property offenses, and includes destruction of property and trespass.
"Tax law violations" includes tax fraud.
"Obscene material" denotes the mail or transport thereof.
"All other felonies" includes felonies with unknown or unclassifiable offense type.
"Misdemeanors" includes misdemeanors, petty offenses, and unknown offense levels.
"Drug possession" also includes other drug misdemeanors.

Figure S.2.
Figure S.2.
uses data from the Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys (EOUSA) to provide an overview of case processing in the Federal criminal justice system.
The figure uses data from two separate cohorts of persons involved in criminal proceedings.
The data on suspects in criminal matters concluded and defendants prosecuted come from the cohort of suspects in matters concluded during October 1, 1993, through September 30, 1994.
(The filing of charges in a criminal case is one conclusion of a matter; the other is the declination of the matter for prosecution.)
For the other three outcomes in figure S.2.
-- offenders convicted, sentenced to prison, or given a term of probation -- the data come from the cohort of defendants in cases terminating during fiscal year 1994 in U.S. district courts (by either a judge or a magistrate).
A total of 102,309 suspects were investigated in matters concluded by U.S. attorneys during 1994 (table 1.2).
Sixty-five percent of these suspects were prosecuted in U.S. district court, either before U.S. district court judges (55,703/102,309 = 54.4%) or before U.S. magistrates (10,710/102,309 = 10.5%).
The conviction data in figure S.2.
refer to defendants in cases terminated in U.S. district court during 1994, whether before U.S. district court judges or U.S. magistrates.
Forty-six percent of the defendants in cases terminating during 1994 were convicted (47,556/102,309).
Of the defendants investigated, 31% (31,805/102,309) were reported as sentenced to a term of imprisonment, and 13% (12,986/102,309) were sentenced to a term of probation without imprisonment.
These figures are based on all charges, whether they eventually were felony or misdemeanor offenses.
