(Refer to the PDQ summary on Levels of Evidence for more information.)
Carcinoma of the prostate is predominantly a tumor of older men, which frequently responds to treatment when widespread and may be cured when localized.
The rate of tumor growth varies from very slow to moderately rapid, and some patients may have prolonged survival even after the cancer has metastasized to distant sites such as bone.
Because the median age at diagnosis is 72 years, many patients--especially those with localized tumors--may die of other illnesses without ever having suffered significant disability from their cancer.
The approach to treatment is influenced by age and coexisting medical problems.
Side effects of various forms of treatment should be considered in selecting appropriate management.
Controversy exists in regard to the value of screening, the most appropriate staging evaluation, and the optimal treatment of each stage of the disease.[1]
A complicating feature of any analysis of survival after treatment of prostate cancer and comparison of the various treatment strategies is that there is evidence of increasing diagnosis of nonlethal tumors as diagnostic methods have changed over time.
Nonrandomized comparisons of treatments may therefore be confounded not only by patient-selection factors but also by time trends.
For example, a population-based study in Sweden showed that from 1960 to the late 1980s, before the use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) for screening purposes, long-term relative survival rates after the diagnosis of prostate cancer improved substantially as more sensitive methods of diagnosis were introduced.
This occurred despite the fact that watchful waiting or palliative hormonal treatment were the most common treatment strategies for localized prostate cancer during the entire era (fewer than 150 radical prostatectomies per year were performed in Sweden during the late 1980s).
The investigators estimated that if all cancers diagnosed in 1960 to 1964 were of the lethal variety, then at least one-third of cancers diagnosed in 1980 to 1984 were of the nonlethal variety.[2][Level of evidence: 3iB]
Another issue complicating comparisons of outcomes among nonconcurrent series of patients is the possibility of changes in criteria for histologic diagnosis of prostate cancer.[3]
The issue of screening asymptomatic men for prostate cancer with digital rectal examination (DRE), PSA, and/or ultrasound is controversial.[4,5] Serum PSA and transrectal ultrasound are more sensitive and will increase the diagnostic yield of prostate cancer when used in combination with rectal examination.
(Refer to the PDQ summary on Screening for Prostate Cancer for more information.)
However, these screening methods are also associated with high false-positive rates and may identify some tumors that will not threaten the patientÃ¯Â¿Â½s health.[6-8] The issue is futher complicated by the morbidity associated with work-up and treatment of such tumors and the considerable cost beyond a routine DRE.
Furthermore, because a high percentage of tumors identified by PSA screening alone have spread outside the prostate, PSA screening may not improve life expectancy.
In any case, the clinician who uses PSA for the detection of prostate cancer should be aware that there is no uniform standard, so that if a laboratory changes to a different assay kit, serial assays may yield nonequivalent PSA values.[9] A multicenter trial sponsored by the National Cancer Institute is under way to test the value of early detection on reducing mortality.[10]
Survival of the patient with prostatic carcinoma is related to the extent of the tumor.
When the cancer is confined to the prostate gland, median survival in excess of 5 years can be anticipated.
Patients with locally advanced cancer are not usually curable, and a substantial fraction will eventually die of their tumor, although median survival may be as long as 5 years.
If prostate cancer has spread to distant organs, current therapy will not cure it.
Median survival is usually 1 to 3 years, and the majority of such patients will die of prostate cancer.
Even in this group of patients, however, indolent clinical courses lasting for many years may be observed.
Other factors affecting the prognosis of patients with prostate cancer that may be useful in making therapeutic decisions include histologic grade of the tumor, patientÃ¯Â¿Â½s age, other medical illnesses, and level of PSA.[11-15] Poorly differentiated tumors are more likely to have already metastasized by the time of diagnosis and are associated with a poorer prognosis.
For patients treated with radiation therapy, the combination of clinical tumor (T) stage, Gleason score, and pretreatment PSA level can be used to more accurately estimate the risk of relapse.[16][Level of evidence: 3iDi]
Diploid tumors have a more favorable outcome than either tetraploid or aneuploid tumors.
The use of flow cytometry techniques and histogram analysis to determine prognosis will require standardization.[17-20]
Definitive treatment is usually considered for younger men with prostate cancer and no major comorbid medical illnesses because younger men are more likely to die of prostate cancer than older men or men with major comorbid medical illness.
Elevations of serum acid phosphatase are associated with poor prognosis in both localized and disseminated disease.
PSA, an organ-specific marker with greater sensitivity and high specificity for prostate tissue, is often used as a tumor marker.[13,14,21-26]
; such patients should be considered for entry into existing clinical trials or receive radiation therapy to control local symptoms.
The role of preoperative (Ã¯Â¿Â½neoadjuvantÃ¯Â¿Â½) hormonal therapy is not established at the present time.[6,7]
Following radical prostatectomy, pathological evaluation stratifies tumor extent into organ-confined, specimen-confined, and margin-positive disease.
The incidence of disease recurrence increases when the tumor is not specimen-confined (extracapsular) and/or the margins are positive.[8-10] There are no results on the outcome of patients with positive surgical margins.
Patients with extraprostatic disease are suitable candidates for clinical trials.[11] These trials include evaluation of postoperative radiation delivery, cytotoxic agents, and hormonal treatment using luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists and/or antiandrogens.

Stage II Prostate Cancer
Note: Some citations in the text of this section are followed by a level of evidence.
The PDQ editorial boards use a formal ranking system to help the reader judge the strength of evidence linked to the reported results of a therapeutic strategy.
(Refer to the PDQ summary on Levels of Evidence for more information.)
Stage II prostate cancer is defined by the following staging systems: * American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM classifications: + T1a, N0, M0, G2 (Gleason 3-4).
+ T1b, N0, M0, any G. + T1c, N0, M0, any G. + T1 (not further specified), N0, M0, any G. + T2, N0, M0, any G. * Jewett staging system: stage A2 or B1 or B2.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ [Note: Previous versions of the AJCC staging system described a tumorÃ¯Â¿Â½s grade as Ã¯Â¿Â½moderately differentiated,Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½poorly differentiated,Ã¯Â¿Â½ or Ã¯Â¿Â½undifferentiated,Ã¯Â¿Â½ but these terms are no longer used.
G2 is the equivalent of Ã¯Â¿Â½ moderately differentiatedÃ¯Â¿Â½ and G3-4 is the equivalent of Ã¯Â¿Â½poorly differentiatedÃ¯Â¿Â½ and Ã¯Â¿Â½undifferentiated.Ã¯Â¿Â½]
Treatment information for patients whose disease has the following TNM classifications: * T1a, N0, M0, G2, 3-4 (Gleason 3-4).
* T1b, N0, M0, any G. * T1c, N0, M0, any G. * T1 (not further specified), N0, M0, any G. * T2, N0, M0, G1-2.
A trial has been reported in which 698 men with newly diagnosed well- or moderately well-differentiated prostate cancers of clinical stages T1b, T1c, or T2 were randomly assigned to receive radical prostatectomy versus watchful waiting.[1]
At a median follow-up of 6.2 years, prostate cancer-specific mortality was 4.6% in the prostatectomy arm of the study versus 8.9% in the watchful waiting arm (P=.02).[1][Level of evidence: 1iiB]
The principal differences in symptoms between the 2 groups were in sexual and in urinary function.
In the surgery and watchful waiting groups, 80% versus 45% of the men answering the questionnaire said they seldom or never had erections sufficient for sexual intercourse.
Forty-nine percent of men in the prostatectomy arm had urinary leakage at least once a week, 43% used protective aids regularly, and 14% used diapers or urine bags compared to 21%, 10%, and 1%, respectively, in the watchful waiting arm.
However, the men on the watchful waiting arm had more obstructive symptoms (e.g., severe symptoms on the American Urologic Symptom Index of 7% in the watchful waiting arm versus 10% in the prostatectomy arm; moderate symptoms 42% versus 24%).[2][Level of evidence: 1iiC]
An older randomized study comparing radical prostatectomy at diagnosis to expectant therapy (careful observation with therapy as needed) in stages I and II cancers did not show a significant difference in survival.[3] However, the trial of 95 patients was not large enough to exclude a small but medically significant difference in overall survival, nor did it include information to measure time to progression, cancer-specific survival, or quality of life.
Standard treatment options: 1.
; however, reported case series have used a variety of definitions of Ã¯Â¿Â½PSA failure.Ã¯Â¿Â½ Although criteria have been developed by the American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology Consensus Panel, no definition to date has been shown to be an accurate surrogate for clinical progression or survival.[29] Therefore, it is difficult to base decisions about instituting additional therapy on biochemical failure.
The implication of the various definitions of Ã¯Â¿Â½PSA failureÃ¯Â¿Â½ for overall survival is not known, and as in the surgical series, many biochemical relapses (rising PSA alone) may not be clinically manifested in patients treated with radiation.[30,31]
A prospective, randomized trial was performed by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) (RTOG 85-31) in patients with T3, N0, or any T, N1, M0 disease who received prostatic and pelvic radiation therapy and then were randomized to receive immediate adjuvant goserelin or observation with administration of goserelin at time of relapse.
In patients assigned to receive adjuvant goserelin, the drug was started during the last week of the radiation therapy course and was continued indefinitely or until signs of progression.
The actuarial overall 5-year survival rate for the entire population of 945 analyzable patients was not statistically significantly different (75% on the adjuvant arm versus 71% on the observation arm, P=.36).
The authors report an improved actuarial 5-year local control rate (85% versus 69%, P
A similar trial was performed by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC).
Patients with T1, T2 (WHO grade 3), N0-NX or T3, T4, N0 disease were randomized to receive either pelvic/prostate radiation, or identical radiation and adjuvant goserelin (with cyproterone acetate for 1 month) starting with radiation and continuing for 3 years.
The 401 patients available for analysis were followed for a median of 66 months.
The Kaplan-Meier estimates of overall survival at 5 years were 78% on the adjuvant arm and 62% on the radiation arm alone (P=.0002).
Similarly, 5-year disease-free survival (74% versus 40%, P=.0001) and local control (98% versus 84%, P
The role of adjuvant hormonal therapy in patients with locally advanced disease has been analyzed by the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) (now the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality).
A majority of patients had more advanced disease, but patients with bulky T2b tumors were included in the study.
Randomized clinical trial evidence comparing radiation therapy to radiation with prolonged androgen suppression was evaluated.
The meta-analysis found a difference in 5-year overall survival in favor of radiation therapy plus continued androgen suppression, compared to radiation therapy alone (hazard ratio=0.631, 95% CI=0.479-0.831).[8][Level of evidence: 1iiA]
Additionally, the RTOG did a study on patients with bulky local disease (T2b, T2c, T3, or T4), with or without nodal involvement below the common iliac chain: 456 men were evaluable and were randomized to receive either radiation alone or radiation with androgen ablation started 8 weeks before radiation and continued for 16 weeks.
At 8 years, overall survival was not statistically significantly different.
However, local control (70% versus 58%) and disease-free survival (33% versus 21%) favored the combined arm.[9][Level of evidence: 1iiA]
A subset analysis of this trial and RTOG 85-31 with 575 patients with T3 N0 M0 disease concluded that long-term hormones compared to short-term hormones resulted in improved biochemical disease-free survival and cause-specific survival.[10]
Initial results from a randomized study of immediate hormonal treatment (orchiectomy or luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) analogue) versus deferred treatment (watchful waiting with hormonal therapy at progression) in men with locally advanced or asymptomatic metastatic prostate cancer showed better overall survival and prostate cancer-specific survival with the immediate treatment.
The incidence of pathologic fractures, spinal cord compression, and ureteric obstruction were also lower in the immediate treatment arm.[11][Level of evidence: 1iiA]

Stage IV Prostate Cancer
Note: Some citations in the text of this section are followed by a level of evidence.
The PDQ editorial boards use a formal ranking system to help the reader judge the strength of evidence linked to the reported results of a therapeutic strategy.
(Refer to the PDQ summary on Levels of Evidence for more information.)
Stage IV prostate cancer is defined by the following staging systems: * American Joint Committee on Cancer TNM classifications: + T4, N0, M0, any G.
+ Any T, N1, M0, any G.
+ Any T, any N, M1, any G. * Jewett staging system: stage D1 or D2.
Treatment selection depends on age, coexisting medical illnesses, symptoms, and whether distant metastases (most often bone) or only regional lymph node involvement is present.
The most common symptoms originate from the urinary tract or from bone metastases.
Palliation of symptoms from the urinary tract with transurethral resection or radiation therapy and palliation of symptoms from bone metastases with radiation therapy or hormonal therapy are an important part of the management of these patients.
Treatment information for patients whose disease has the following classifications: * AJCC TNM classification: + T4, N0, M0, any G.
+ Any T, N1, M0, any G. * Jewett staging system: D1.
The Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) (now the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality) performed a systematic review of the available randomized, clinical trial evidence comparing radiation therapy to radiation therapy with prolonged androgen suppression performed by its Technology Evaluation Center, an evidence-based Practice Center of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association.[1][Level of evidence: 1iiA]
The meta-analysis found a difference in 5-year overall survival in favor of radiation therapy plus continued androgen suppression, compared to radiation therapy alone (hazard ratio=0.631, 95% CI=0.479-0.831).
This reduction in overall mortality indicates that adjuvant androgen suppression should be initiated at the time of radiation and continued for several years.
The optimal duration of therapy and the issue of utility of neoadjuvant hormonal therapy remain to be determined.
In a small randomized trial of 98 men who underwent radical prostatectomy plus pelvic lymphadenectomy and were found to have nodal metastases (stage T1-2 N1 M0), immediate continuous hormonal therapy with the LHRH agonist goserelin or with orchiectomy was compared to deferred therapy until documentation of disease progression.[2][Level of evidence: 1iA]
At 100 months, the survival rate in the immediate therapy arm was about 80%, versus about 60% for the deferred therapy arm.
Treatment information for patients whose disease has the following classifications: * AJCC TNM classification: Any T, any N, M1, any G. * Jewett staging system: D2.
.[1-3] These patients should have a negative bone scan and tumors confined to the prostate gland (stages I and II).
Prostatectomy can be performed by the perineal or retropubic approach.
The perineal approach requires a separate incision for lymph node dissection.
Laparoscopic lymphadenectomy is technically possible and accomplished with much less patient morbidity.
[4] For small, well-differentiated nodules, the incidence of positive pelvic nodes is less than 20%, and pelvic node dissection may be omitted.[5]
The value of pelvic node dissection (open surgical or laparoscopic) is not therapeutic but spares patients with positive nodes the morbidity of prostatectomy.
Radical prostatectomy is not usually performed if frozen section evaluation of pelvic nodes reveals metastases
; such patients should be considered for entry into existing clinical trials or receive radiation therapy to control local symptoms.
The role of preoperative (Ã¯Â¿Â½neoadjuvantÃ¯Â¿Â½) hormonal therapy is not established at the present time.[6,7]
Following radical prostatectomy, pathological evaluation stratifies tumor extent into organ-confined, specimen-confined, and margin-positive disease.
The incidence of disease recurrence increases when the tumor is not specimen-confined (extracapsular) and/or the margins are positive.[8-10] There are no results on the outcome of patients with positive surgical margins.
Patients with extraprostatic disease are suitable candidates for clinical trials.[11] These trials include evaluation of postoperative radiation delivery, cytotoxic agents, and hormonal treatment using luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists and/or antiandrogens.
Cryosurgery is a surgical technique that involves destruction of prostate cancer cells by intermittent freezing of the prostate tissue with cryoprobes, followed by thawing
.[12][Level of evidence: 3iiiDiii]
Serious toxic effects include bladder outlet injury, urinary incontinence, sexual impotence, and rectal injury.
The technique of cryosurgery is under development.
Candidates for definitive radiation therapy must have a confirmed pathological diagnosis of cancer that is clinically confined to the prostate and/or surrounding tissues
(stages I, II, and III).
Patients should have a bone scan and computed tomographic scan negative for metastases, but staging laparotomy and lymph node dissection are not required.
Prophylactic irradiation of clinically or pathologically uninvolved pelvic lymph nodes does not appear to improve overall survival or prostate cancer-specific survival.[13][Level of evidence: 1iiA]
A retrospective review of 999 patients treated with megavoltage irradiation showed cause-specific survival rates to be significantly different at 10 years by T-stage: T1 (79%), T2 (66%), T3 (55%), and T4 (22%).[15]
Interstitial brachytherapy has been employed in several centers, generally for patients with T1 and T2 tumors.
Patients are selected for favorable characteristics, including low Gleason score, low PSA level, and stage T1 to T2 tumors.
Information and further study are required to better define the effects of modern interstitial brachytherapy on disease control and quality of life and to determine the contribution of favorable patient selection to outcomes.[17][Level of evidence: 3iiiDiii]
Asymptomatic patients of advanced age or with concomitant illness may warrant consideration of careful observation without immediate active treatment, especially those patients with low-grade and early-stage tumors
.[18,19] One population-based study with 15 years of follow-up (mean observation time=12.5 years) has shown excellent survival without any treatment in patients with well-differentiated or moderately well-differentiated tumors clinically confined to the prostate, irrespective of age.[8]
There is wide geographic variation in these rates.[21]
A structured literature review of 144 papers has been done in an attempt to compare the 3 primary treatment strategies for clinically localized prostate cancer:[22] * Radical prostatectomy.
* Definitive radiation therapy.
* Watchful waiting.
The authors concluded that poor reporting and selection factors within all series precluded a valid comparison of efficacy for the 3 management strategies.
In another literature review of a case series of patients with palpable, clinically localized disease, the authors found that 10-year prostate cancer-specific survival rates were best in radical prostatectomy series (about 93%), worst in radiation therapy series (about 75%), and intermediate with deferred treatment (about 85%).[23] Because it is highly unlikely that radiation would worsen disease-specific survival, the most likely explanation is that selection factors affect choice of treatment.
Such selection factors make comparisons of therapeutic strategies imprecise.[24] A retrospective analysis of outcomes of men demonstrated a 10-year disease-specific survival rate of 94% for expectant management for Gleason score 2 to 4 tumors and 75% for Gleason score 5 to 7 tumors.[25]
A randomized trial comparing radical prostatectomy to watchful waiting in early stage disease (clinical stages T1b, T1c, or T2) showed a statistically significant difference in prostate cancer specific mortality, but not in overall mortality, favoring prostatectomy after a median follow-up of 6.2 years.[27][Level of Evidence: 1iiB]
Results from an ongoing randomized trial in the United States comparing radical prostatectomy to watchful waiting (PIVOT: Prostate Intervention Versus Observation Trial) have not been reported.[28] The PIVOT uses overall mortality as its primary endpoint.
Surgical complications
Complications of radical prostatectomy can include urinary incontinence, urethral stricture, impotence, and the morbidity associated with general anesthesia and a major surgical procedure.
An analysis of Medicare records on 101,604 radical prostatectomies performed from 1991 to 1994 showed a 30-day operative mortality rate of 0.54%, a rehospitalization rate of 4.5%, and a major complication rate of 28.6%.
Over the study period, these rates decreased by 30%, 8%, and 12%, respectively.[29] Prostatectomies done at hospitals where fewer prostatectomies were performed were associated with higher rates of 30-day postoperative mortality, major acute surgical complications, longer hospital stays, and higher rates of rehospitalization than those done at hospitals where more prostatectomies were performed.
Morbidity and mortality rates increase with age and were appreciably greater in patients older than 75 years.[21]
In 1 large case series of men undergoing the anatomic (nerve-sparing) technique of radical prostatectomy, only about 6% of men required the use of pads for urinary incontinence, but an unknown additional proportion of men had occasional urinary dribbling.
About 40% to 65% of men who were sexually potent before surgery retained potency adequate for vaginal penetration and sexual intercourse.[30] Preservation of potency with this technique is dependent on tumor stage and patient age, but the operation probably induces at least a partial deficit in nearly all patients.[30]
A national survey of Medicare patients who underwent radical prostatectomy in 1988 to 1990 reported more morbidity than in the case series.[31] In that survey, more than 30% of men reported the need for pads or clamps for urinary wetness, and 63% of all patients reported a current problem with wetness.
About 60% reported having no erections since surgery; about 90% had no erections sufficient for intercourse during the month before the survey.
About 28% reported follow-up treatment of cancer with radiation and/or hormonal therapy within 4 years after their prostatectomy.
In a population-based longitudinal cohort (Prostate Cancer Outcomes Study) of 1291 men 39 to 79 years of age who had recently undergone radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer, 8.4% had either frequent urinary incontinence or no urinary control at 18 months after surgery.[32] About 39% reported complete urinary control, and the remaining patients had varying degrees of urinary incontinence.
Inability to have an erection sufficient for intercourse was reported by 59.9% of men (65.6% of men who had non-nerve-sparing surgery, 58.6% who had unilateral nerve-sparing surgery, and 56.0% who had bilateral nerve- sparing surgery, P=.001 for the difference between non-nerve-sparing and bilateral nerve-sparing surgery).
Reasons for the difference in outcomes between the population-based surveys and previous case series could include: * Age difference among the populations.
* Surgical expertise at the major reporting centers.
* Selection factors.
* Publication bias of favorable series.
* Different methods of collecting information from patients.
Case series of 93, 459, and 89 men who had undergone radical prostatectomy by experienced surgeons showed rates of impotence as high as those in the national Medicare survey when men were carefully questioned about sexual potency, although the men in the case series were on average younger than those in the Medicare survey.[33-35] One of the case series used the s
A cross-sectional survey of prostate cancer patients who had been treated in a managed care setting by radical prostatectomy, radiation, or watchful waiting showed substantial sexual and urinary dysfunction in the prostatectomy group.[36] Results reported by the patients were consistent with those from the national Medicare survey.
In addition, although statistical power was limited, differences in sexual and urinary dysfunction between men who had undergone either anatomic (nerve-sparing) or standard radical prostatectomy were not statistically significant.
This issue, therefore, requires more study.
Radical prostatectomy may also cause fecal incontinence, and the incidence may vary with surgical method.[37] In a national survey sample of 907 men who had undergone radical prostatectomy at least 1 year before the survey, 32% of the men who had undergone perineal (anatomic Ã¯Â¿Â½nerve-sparingÃ¯Â¿Â½) radical prostatectomy and 17% of the men who had undergone retropubic radical prostatectomy reported accidents of fecal leakage.
Ten percent and 4%, respectively, reported moderate to large amounts of fecal leakage.
Less than 15% of men with fecal incontinence had reported it to a physician or health care provider.
Radiation complications
Definitive external-beam radiation therapy can result in acute cystitis, proctitis, and sometimes enteritis.[1,35,38-40] These conditions are generally reversible but may be chronic and rarely require surgical intervention.
Potency, in the short term, is preserved with irradiation in the majority of cases but may diminish over time.[40] A cross-sectional survey of prostate cancer patients who had been treated in a managed care setting by radical prostatectomy, radiation, or watchful waiting showed substantial sexual and urinary dysfunction in the radiation therapy group.[36]
Morbidity may be reduced with the employment of sophisticated radiation techniques--such as the use of linear accelerators--and careful simulation and treatment planning.[41] Radiation side effects of three-dimensional conformal versus conventional radiation therapy using similar doses (total dose of 60-64 Gy) have been compared in a randomized nonblinded study.[42]
However, the cumulative incidence of mild or greater proctitis was lower in the conformal arm than in the standard therapy arm (37% versus 56%, P=.004).
Urinary symptoms were similar in the 2 groups, as were local tumor control and overall survival rates at 5 yearsÃ¯Â¿Â½ follow-up.
Radiation therapy can be delivered after an extra-peritoneal lymph node dissection without an increase in complications if careful attention is paid to radiation technique.
The treatment field should not include the dissected pelvic nodes.
Previous transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) increases the risk of stricture above that seen with radiation alone, but if radiation is delayed 4 to 6 weeks after the TURP, the risk of stricture can be minimized.[43-45] Pretreatment TURP to relieve obstructive symptoms has been associated with tumor dissemination; however, multivariate analysis in pathologically staged cases indicates that this is the result of a worse underlying prognosis of the cases that require transurethral resection rather than the result of the procedure itself.[46]
A population-based survey of Medicare recipients who had received radiation therapy as primary treatment of prostate cancer (similar in design to the survey of Medicare patients who underwent radical prostatectomy,[31] described above) has been reported, showing substantial differences in post-treatment morbidity profiles between surgery and radiation.[47]
A larger proportion of patients treated with radiation before surgery reported the ability to have an erection sufficient for intercourse in the month before the survey (men 
However, men receiving radiation were more likely to report problems with bowel function, especially frequent bowel movements (10% versus 3%).
As in the results of the surgical patient survey, about 24% of radiation patients reported additional subsequent treatment of known or suspected cancer persistence or recurrence within 3 years of primary therapy.
Sildenafil citrate may be effective in the management of sexual dysfunction after radiation therapy in some men.
In a randomized placebo-controlled crossover design study of 60 men who had undergone radiation therapy for clinically localized prostate cancer, and who reported erectile dysfunction that began after their radiation, 55% reported successful intercourse after sildenafil versus 18% after placebo (P
A prospective community-based cohort of men 55 to 74 years of age treated with radical prostatectomy (N=1156) or external-beam radiation therapy (N=435) attempted to compare acute and chronic complications of the 2 treatment strategies after adjusting for baseline differences in patient characteristics and underlying health.[50] Regarding acute treatment-related morbidity, radical prostatectomy was associated with higher rates of cardiopulmonary complications (5.5% vs. 1.9%), as well as the need for treatment of urinary strictures (17.4% vs. 7.2%).
Radiation therapy was associated with more acute rectal proctitis (18.7% vs. 1.6%).
With regard to chronic treatment-related morbidity, radical prostatectomy was associated with more urinary incontinence (9.6% vs. 3.5%) and impotence (80% vs. 62%).
Radiation therapy was associated with slightly greater declines in bowel function.
Hormone therapy complications
Several different hormonal approaches can benefit men in various stages of prostate cancer.
These approaches include bilateral orchiectomy, estrogen therapy, LHRH agonists, antiandrogens, ketoconazole, and aminoglutethimide.
Benefits of bilateral orchiectomy include ease of the procedure, compliance, its immediacy in lowering testosterone levels, and low cost.
Disadvantages include psychologic effects, loss of libido, impotence, hot flashes, and osteoporosis.[51]
Estrogens at a dose of 3 milligrams per day of diethylstilbestrol will achieve castrate levels of testosterone.
Like orchiectomy, estrogens may cause loss of libido and impotence.
Gynecomastia may be prevented by low-dose radiation to the breasts.
However, estrogen is seldom used today because of the risk of serious side effects, including myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, and pulmonary embolism.
LHRH agonists such as leuprolide, goserelin, and buserelin will lower testosterone to castrate levels.
Like orchiectomy and estrogens, LHRH agonists cause impotence, hot flashes, and loss of libido.
Tumor flare reactions may occur transiently but can be prevented by antiandrogens or by short-term estrogens at low dose for several weeks.
The pure antiandrogen flutamide may cause diarrhea, breast tenderness, and nausea.
There have been case reports of fatal and nonfatal liver toxic effects.[52] Bicalutamide may cause nausea, breast tenderness, hot flashes, loss of libido, and impotence.[53]
Long-term use of ketoconazole can result in impotence, pruritus, nail changes, and adrenal insufficiency.
Aminoglutethimide commonly causes sedation and skin rashes.
A national Medicare survey of men who had undergone radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer showed that there was a decrease in all 7 health-related quality-of-life measures (impact of cancer and treatment, concern regarding body image, mental health, general health, activity, worries about cancer and dying, and energy) in men who had received androgen depletion therapy (either medically or surgically induced) versus those who had not.[54][Level of evidence: 3iC]
Androgen deprivation therapy also can cause osteoporosis.
A small nonblinded study with short follow-up suggests that the bisphosphonate pamidronate can prevent bone loss in men receiving a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist for prostate cancer.[56] Forty-seven prostate cancer patients (41 evaluable) with locally advanced prostate cancer but no known bone metastases were randomly assigned to receive 3-monthly depot leuprolide with or without pamidronate (60 mg intravenously).
There were no bone fractures reported in either group.
The use of surrogate endpoints and unblinded assessment of endpoints make it difficult to know with certainty whether pamidronate use would prevent fractures.[56][Level of evidence: 1iiDii]

Stage I Prostate Cancer
Note: Some citations in the text of this section are followed by a level of evidence.
The PDQ editorial boards use a formal ranking system to help the reader judge the strength of evidence linked to the reported results of a therapeutic strategy.
(Refer to the PDQ summary on Levels of Evidence for more information.)
Stage I prostate cancer is defined by the following staging systems: * American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM classification: T1a, N0, M0, G1 (Gleason 2-4).
* Jewett staging system: stage A1.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ [Note: Previous versions of the AJCC staging system described a tumorÃ¯Â¿Â½s grade as Ã¯Â¿Â½well-differentiatedÃ¯Â¿Â½ but this term is no longer used.
G1 is the equivalent of Ã¯Â¿Â½well-differentiated.Ã¯Â¿Â½]
The frequency of clinically silent, nonmetastatic prostate cancer that can be found at autopsy greatly increases with age and may be as high as 50% to 60% in men 90 years of age and older.
Undoubtedly, the incidental discovery of these occult cancers at prostatic surgery performed for other reasons accounts for the similar survival of men with stage I prostate cancer, compared to the normal male population, adjusted for age.
Many stage I cancers are well-differentiated and only focally involve the gland (T1a, N0, M0); the majority require no treatment other than careful follow-up.[1]
In a retrospective pooled analysis, 828 men with clinically localized prostate cancer were managed by initial conservative therapy with subsequent hormone therapy given at the time of symptomatic disease progression.
This study showed that the patients with grade 1 or 2 tumors experienced a disease-specific survival of 87% at 10 years and that their overall survival closely approximated the expected survival among men of similar ages in the general population.[2]
In younger patients (ages 50-60) whose expected survival is long, treatment should be considered.[3] Less differentiated cancers that involve more than a few pieces of resected tissue (T1b, N0, M0) are biologically more aggressive.
However, the trial of 95 patients was not large enough to exclude a small but medically significant difference in overall survival, nor did it include information to measure time to progression, cancer-specific survival, or quality of life.
Radical prostatectomy, external-beam radiation therapy, and interstitial implantation of radioisotopes and watchful waiting yield apparently similar survival rates in noncontrolled selected series.
The decision to treat should be made in the context of the patientÃ¯Â¿Â½s age, associated medical illnesses, and personal desires.[3]
Standard treatment options: 1.
Careful observation without further immediate treatment in selected patients
.[2-5] 2.
External-beam radiation therapy.[6-10] Definitive radiation therapy should be delayed 4 to 6 weeks after transurethral resection to reduce incidence of stricture.[]
Radical prostatectomy, usually with pelvic lymphadenectomy
(with or without the nerve-sparing technique designed to preserve potency).[12-14] Radical prostatectomy may be difficult after a transurethral resection of the prostate.
Consideration may be given to postoperative radiation therapy for patients who are found to have capsular penetration or seminal vesicle invasion by tumor at the time of prostatectomy or who have a detectable level of prostate-specific antigen more than 3 weeks after surgery.[15-20] Because duration of follow-up in available studies is still relatively short, the value of postoperative radiation therapy is yet to be determined; however, postoperative radiation therapy does reduce local recurrence.[21]
4.
Interstitial implantation of radioisotopes (i.e., I-125, palladium, iridium) done through a transperineal technique with either ultrasound or CT guidance is being done in carefully selected patients with T1 or T2A tumors.
Short-term results in these patients are similar to those for radical prostatectomy or external-beam radiation therapy.[22-24][Level of evidence: 3iiiDiii]
The rate of maintenance of sexual potency with interstitial implants has been reported to be 86% to 92%, [22,24] which compares with rates of 10% to 40% with radical prostatectomy and 40% to 60% with external-beam radiation therapy.
However, urinary tract frequency, urgency, and less commonly, urinary retention are seen in most patients but subside with time.
Rectal ulceration may also be seen.
In 1 series, a 10% 2-year actuarial genitourinary grade 2 complication rate and a 12% risk of rectal ulceration was seen.
This risk decreased with increased operator experience and modification of implant technique.[22] Long-term follow-up of these patients is necessary to assess treatment efficacy and side effects.
Retropubic freehand implantation with I-125 has been associated with an increased local failure and complication rate [25,26] and is now rarely done.
5.
External-beam radiation therapy designed to decrease exposure of normal tissues using methods such as computed tomography-based 3-D conformal treatment planning is under clinical evaluation.[27]

Stage II Prostate Cancer
Note: Some citations in the text of this section are followed by a level of evidence.
The PDQ editorial boards use a formal ranking system to help the reader judge the strength of evidence linked to the reported results of a therapeutic strategy.
(Refer to the PDQ summary on Levels of Evidence for more information.)
Stage II prostate cancer is defined by the following staging systems: * American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM classifications: + T1a, N0, M0, G2 (Gleason 3-4).
+ T1b, N0, M0, any G. + T1c, N0, M0, any G. + T1 (not further specified), N0, M0, any G. + T2, N0, M0, any G. * Jewett staging system: stage A2 or B1 or B2.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ [Note: Previous versions of the AJCC staging system described a tumorÃ¯Â¿Â½s grade as Ã¯Â¿Â½moderately differentiated,Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½poorly differentiated,Ã¯Â¿Â½ or Ã¯Â¿Â½undifferentiated,Ã¯Â¿Â½ but these terms are no longer used.
G2 is the equivalent of Ã¯Â¿Â½ moderately differentiatedÃ¯Â¿Â½ and G3-4 is the equivalent of Ã¯Â¿Â½poorly differentiatedÃ¯Â¿Â½ and Ã¯Â¿Â½undifferentiated.Ã¯Â¿Â½]
Treatment information for patients whose disease has the following TNM classifications: * T1a, N0, M0, G2, 3-4 (Gleason 3-4).
* T1b, N0, M0, any G. * T1c, N0, M0, any G. * T1 (not further specified), N0, M0, any G. * T2, N0, M0, G1-2.
A trial has been reported in which 698 men with newly diagnosed well- or moderately well-differentiated prostate cancers of clinical stages T1b, T1c, or T2 were randomly assigned to receive radical prostatectomy versus watchful waiting.[1] In contrast to U.S. prostate cancer patients, most of the men in this study had been diagnosed clinically, rather than by screening.
At a median follow-up of 6.2 years, prostate cancer-specific mortality was 4.6% in the prostatectomy arm of the study versus 8.9% in the watchful waiting arm (P=.02).[1][Level of evidence: 1iiB]
The principal differences in symptoms between the 2 groups were in sexual and in urinary function.
In the surgery and watchful waiting groups, 80% versus 45% of the men answering the questionnaire said they seldom or never had erections sufficient for sexual intercourse.
Forty-nine percent of men in the prostatectomy arm had urinary leakage at least once a week, 43% used protective aids regularly, and 14% used diapers or urine bags compared to 21%, 10%, and 1%, respectively, in the watchful waiting arm.
However, the men on the watchful waiting arm had more obstructive symptoms (e.g., severe symptoms on the American Urologic Symptom Index of 7% in the watchful waiting arm versus 10% in the prostatectomy arm; moderate symptoms 42% versus 24%).[2][Level of evidence: 1iiC]
An older randomized study comparing radical prostatectomy at diagnosis to expectant therapy (careful observation with therapy as needed) in stages I and II cancers did not show a significant difference in survival.[3] However, the trial of 95 patients was not large enough to exclude a small but medically significant difference in overall survival, nor did it include information to measure time to progression, cancer-specific survival, or quality of life.
Standard treatment options: 1.
Radical prostatectomy, usually with pelvic lymphadenectomy (with or without the nerve-sparing technique designed to preserve potency).[4-6]
Radical prostatectomy may be difficult after a transurethral resection of the prostate.
Consideration may be given to postoperative radiation therapy for patients who are found to have capsular penetration or seminal vesicle invasion by tumor at the time of prostatectomy or who have a detectable level of prostate-specific antigen more than 3 weeks after surgery.[7-12] Because duration of follow-up in available studies is still relatively short, the value of postoperative radiation therapy is yet to be determined; however, postoperative radiation therapy does reduce local recurrence.[13]
2.
Careful observation without further immediate treatment in selected patients.[3,14]
External-beam radiation therapy
.[15-19] Prophylactic irradiation of clinically or pathologically uninvolved pelvic lymph nodes does not appear to improve overall survival or prostate cancer-specific survival.[20]
Interstitial implantation of radioisotopes (i.e., I-125, palladium, iridium) done through a transperineal technique with either ultrasound or CT guidance is being done in carefully selected patients with T1 or T2A tumors.
Short-term results in these patients are similar to those for radical prostatectomy or external-beam radiation therapy.[22-24][Level of evidence: 3iiiDiii]
The rate of maintenance of sexual potency with interstitial implants has been reported to be 86% to 92%, [22,24] which compares with rates of 10% to 40% with radical prostatectomy and 40% to 60% with external-beam radiation therapy.
However, urinary tract frequency, urgency, and less commonly, urinary retention are seen in most patients but subside with time.
Rectal ulceration may also be seen.
In 1 series, a 10% 2-year actuarial genitourinary grade 2 complication rate and a 12% risk of rectal ulceration was seen.
This risk decreased with increased operator experience and modification of implant technique.[22] Long-term follow-up of these patients is necessary to assess treatment efficacy and side effects.
Retropubic freehand implantation with I-125 has been associated with an increased local failure and complication rate [25,26] and is now rarely done.

External-beam radiation therapy designed to decrease exposure of normal tissues using methods such as computed tomography-based 3-D conformal treatment planning is under clinical evaluation.[27]
6.
Other clinical trials.
Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the NCI Cancer.gov Web site.
Treatment information for patients whose disease has the following classifications: * AJCC TNM classification: T2, N0, M0, any G. * Jewett staging system: A2 or B1 or B2.
Radical prostatectomy, external-beam irradiation, and interstitial implantation of radioisotopes are each employed in the treatment of stage II prostate cancer with apparently similar therapeutic effects.
Radical prostatectomy and radiation therapy yield apparently similar survival rates with up to 10 years follow-up.
For well-selected patients, radical prostatectomy can achieve 15-year survival comparable to an age-matched population without prostate cancer.[14] Unfortunately, randomized comparative trials of these treatment methods with prolonged follow-up are lacking.
Patients with a small palpable cancer (T2a, N0, M0) fare better than patients in whom the disease involves both lobes of the gland (T2b, N0, M0).
Patients proven free of node metastases by pelvic lymphadenectomy fare better than patients in whom this staging procedure is not performed; however, this is the result of selection of patients who have a more favorable prognosis.
Side effects of the various forms of therapy--including impotence, incontinence, and bowel injury--should be considered in determining which type of treatment to employ.
In a retrospective pooled analysis, 828 men with clinically localized prostate cancer were managed by initial conservative therapy with subsequent hormone therapy given at the time of symptomatic disease progression.
This study showed that the patients with grade 1 or 2 tumors experienced a disease-specific survival of 87% at 10 years and that their overall survival closely approximated the expected survival among men of similar ages in the general population.[14] The decision to treat should be made in the context of the patientÃ¯Â¿Â½s age, associated medical illnesses, and personal desires.
The role of adjuvant hormonal therapy in patients with locally advanced disease has been analyzed by the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (now the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality).
A majority of patients have more advanced disease, but patients with bulky T2b tumors were included in the study groups re-evaluating the role of adjuvant hormonal therapy in patients with locally advanced disease.
Randomized clinical trial evidence comparing radiation therapy to radiation with prolonged androgen suppression has been published.
The meta-analysis found a difference in 5-year overall survival in favor of radiation therapy plus continued androgen suppression compared to radiation therapy alone (hazard ratio=0.631, 95% CI=0.479-0.831).[28][Level of evidence: 1iiA]
Standard treatment options: 1.
Radical prostatectomy, usually with pelvic lymphadenectomy
.[4,5,29,30] If allowed by the extent of tumor, anatomical dissection that preserves nerves necessary for erection avoids impotence postoperatively in some patients.[6,29]
The value of postoperative radiation therapy is yet to be determined.
Postoperative radiation therapy does reduce local recurrence; however, it has not been proven to extend survival.[13] Clinical trials are in progress to test these questions.
Careful treatment planning is necessary to avoid morbidity.[7-12] The role of preoperative (Ã¯Â¿Â½neoadjuvantÃ¯Â¿Â½) hormonal therapy is not established at the present time.[31,32]
External-beam irradiation
.[15-19,34] Prophylactic irradiation of clinically or pathologically uninvolved pelvic lymph nodes does not appear to improve overall survival or prostate cancer-specific survival.[20]
Careful observation without further immediate treatment (in selected patients).[3,14]
Interstitial implantation of radioisotopes (i.e., I-125, palladium, iridium) done through a transperineal technique with either ultrasound or CT guidance is being done in carefully selected patients with T1 or T2A tumors.
Short-term results in these carefully selected patients are similar to those for radical prostatectomy or external-beam radiation therapy.[22-24][Level of evidence: 3iiiDiii]
The rate of maintenance of sexual potency with interstitial implants has been reported to be 86% to 92%,[22,35] which compares with rates of 10% to 40% with radical prostatectomy and 40% to 60% with external beam-radiation therapy.
However, urinary tract frequency, urgency, or less commonly, urinary retention are seen in most patients but subside with time.
Rectal ulceration may also be seen.
In 1 series, a 10% 2-year actuarial genitourinary grade 2 complication rate and a 12% risk of rectal ulceration was seen.
This risk decreased with increased operator experience and modification of implant technique.[22] Long-term follow-up of these patients is necessary to assess treatment efficacy and side effects.

External-beam radiation therapy designed to decrease exposure of normal tissues using methods such as computed tomography-based 3-D conformal treatment planning is under clinical evaluation.[27]
Ultrasound-guided percutaneous cryosurgery is under clinical evaluation.
Cryosurgery is a surgical technique that involves destruction of prostate cancer cells by intermittent freezing of the prostate tissue with cryoprobes, followed by thawing
.[36][Level of evidence: 3iiiDiii]
Serious toxic effects include bladder outlet injury, urinary incontinence, sexual impotence, and rectal injury.
The technique of cryosurgery is under development.

Stage III Prostate Cancer
Note: Some citations in the text of this section are followed by a level of evidence.
The PDQ editorial boards use a formal ranking system to help the reader judge the strength of evidence linked to the reported results of a therapeutic strategy.
(Refer to the PDQ summary on Levels of Evidence for more information.)
External-beam irradiation, interstitial implantation of radioisotopes, and radical prostatectomy are used.[1] The results of radical prostatectomy in stage III patients are greatly inferior compared to results in patients with stage II cancer.
Interstitial implantation of radioisotopes is technically difficult in large tumors.
External-beam irradiation using a linear accelerator is the most appropriate treatment for the majority of patients with stage III prostate cancer, and large series support its success in achieving local disease control and disease-free survival.[2,3] Prognosis is greatly affected by whether regional lymph nodes are evaluated and proven not to be involved.
The patientÃ¯Â¿Â½s symptoms related to cancer, age, and coexisting medical illnesses should be taken into account before deciding on a therapeutic plan.
In a series of 372 patients treated with radiation therapy and followed for 20 years, 47% eventually died of prostate cancer, but 44% died of intercurrent illnesses without evidence of prostate cancer.[3]
Hormonal therapy should be considered in conjunction with radiation.
Several studies have investigated its utility in patients with locally advanced disease.
A prospective, randomized trial was performed by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) (RTOG 85-31) in patients with T3, N0, or any T, N1, M0 disease who received prostatic and pelvic radiation therapy and then were randomized to receive immediate adjuvant goserelin or observation with administration of goserelin at time of relapse.
In patients assigned to receive adjuvant goserelin, the drug was started during the last week of the radiation therapy course and was continued indefinitely or until signs of progression.
The actuarial overall 5-year survival rate for the entire population of 945 analyzable patients was not statistically significantly different (75% on the adjuvant arm versus 71% on the observation arm, P=.36).
The authors report an improved actuarial 5-year local control rate (85% versus 69%, P
A similar trial was performed by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC).
Patients with T1, T2 (WHO grade 3), N0-NX or T3, T4, N0 disease were randomized to receive either pelvic/prostate radiation, or identical radiation and adjuvant goserelin (with cyproterone acetate for 1 month) starting with radiation and continuing for 3 years.
The 401 patients available for analysis were followed for a median of 66 months.
The Kaplan-Meier estimates of overall survival at 5 years were 78% on the adjuvant arm and 62% on the radiation arm alone (P=.0002).
Similarly, 5-year disease-free survival (74% versus 40%, P=.0001) and local control (98% versus 84%, P
The role of adjuvant hormonal therapy in patients with locally advanced disease has been analyzed by the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) (now the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality).
A majority of patients had more advanced disease, but patients with bulky T2b tumors were included in the study.
Randomized clinical trial evidence comparing radiation therapy to radiation with prolonged androgen suppression was evaluated.
The meta-analysis found a difference in 5-year overall survival in favor of radiation therapy plus continued androgen suppression, compared to radiation therapy alone (hazard ratio=0.631, 95% CI=0.479-0.831).[8][Level of evidence: 1iiA]
Additionally, the RTOG did a study on patients with bulky local disease (T2b, T2c, T3, or T4), with or without nodal involvement below the common iliac chain: 456 men were evaluable and were randomized to receive either radiation alone or radiation with androgen ablation started 8 weeks before radiation and continued for 16 weeks.
At 8 years, overall survival was not statistically significantly different.
However, local control (70% versus 58%) and disease-free survival (33% versus 21%) favored the combined arm.[9][Level of evidence: 1iiA]
A subset analysis of this trial and RTOG 85-31 with 575 patients with T3 N0 M0 disease concluded that long-term hormones compared to short-term hormones resulted in improved biochemical disease-free survival and cause-specific survival.[10]
Initial results from a randomized study of immediate hormonal treatment (orchiectomy or luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) analogue) versus deferred treatment (watchful waiting with hormonal therapy at progression) in men with locally advanced or asymptomatic metastatic prostate cancer showed better overall survival and prostate cancer-specific survival with the immediate treatment.
The incidence of pathologic fractures, spinal cord compression, and ureteric obstruction were also lower in the immediate treatment arm.[11][Level of evidence: 1iiA]
Standard treatment options: 1.
External-beam radiation.[2,3,12-14] Hormonal therapy should be considered in addition to external-beam radiation
.[8,9,15,16] Definitive radiation therapy should be delayed until 4 to 6 weeks after transurethral resection to reduce incidence of stricture.[17]
Hormonal manipulations (orchiectomy or LHRH agonist).[11][Level of evidence: 1iiA]
Radical prostatectomy, usually with pelvic lymphadenectomy (highly selected patients).[19]
Consideration may be given to postoperative radiation therapy for patients who are found to have capsular penetration or seminal vesicle invasion by tumor at the time of prostatectomy or a detectable level of prostate-specific antigen more than 3 weeks after surgery.[14,20,21] However, because the duration of follow-up in available studies is still relatively short, the value of postoperative irradiation in reducing the incidence of local failure has yet to be determined.
Clinical trials are in progress.
Careful treatment planning is necessary to avoid morbidity.
The role of preoperative (Ã¯Â¿Â½neoadjuvantÃ¯Â¿Â½) hormonal therapy is not established at the present time.[22,23] Also, the morphologic changes induced by neoadjuvant androgen ablation may even complicate assessment of surgical margins and capsular involvement.[24]
Careful observation without further immediate treatment
.[25] Symptomatic treatment: Since many stage III patients have urinary symptoms, control of symptoms is an important consideration in treatment.
This may often be accomplished by radiation therapy, radical surgery, transurethral resection of the prostate, or hormonal manipulation.
1.
Radiation therapy.[2,3,12,13] External-beam radiation therapy designed to decrease exposure of normal tissues using methods such as computed tomography-based 3-D conformal treatment planning is under clinical evaluation.
Hormonal manipulations effectively used as initial therapy for prostate cancer:
a.
Orchiectomy. b. Leuprolide or other LHRH agonists (Zoladex) in daily or depot preparations (these agents may be associated with tumor flare). c. Estrogen (diethylstlbestrol [DES] is no longer available in the United States). d. Nonsteroidal antiandrogen (e.g., flutamide, nilutamide, bicalutamide) or steroidal antiandrogen (cyproterone acetate).
A meta-analysis of randomized trials comparing various hormonal monotherapies in men with stage III or IV prostate cancer (predominantly stage IV) came to the following conclusions: a.
Overall survival at 2 years using any of the LHRH agonists is similar to treatment with orchiectomy or 3 milligrams per day of DES (hazard ratio=1.26, 95% CI=0.92-1.39). b. Survival rates at 2 years are similar or worse with nonsteroidal antiandrogens compared to orchiectomy (hazard ratio=1.22, 95% CI=0.99-1.50). c. Treatment withdrawals, used as a surrogate for adverse effects, occurred less with LHRH agonists (0%-4%) than with nonsteroidal antiandrogens (4%-10%).[26][Level of evidence: 1iiA]
Palliative surgery (transurethral resection).
Interstitial implantation combined with external-beam radiation therapy is being used in selected T3 patients, but little information is available.[27]
5.
Clinical trials employing alternative forms of radiation therapy.
A randomized trial from the RTOG reported improved local control and survival with mixed-beam (neutron/photon) radiation therapy, compared to standard photon radiation therapy.[28]
Local-regional control was improved with neutron treatment, but no difference in overall survival was seen, although follow-up was shorter in this trial.
Decreased complications were seen with the use of a multileaf collimator.[29] Proton-beam radiation therapy is also under investigation.[30]
Other clinical trials.[31] Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the NCI Cancer.gov Web site.
7.
Ultrasound-guided percutaneous cryosurgery is under clinical evaluation.
Cryosurgery is a surgical technique that involves destruction of prostate cancer cells by intermittent freezing of the prostate tissue with cryoprobes, followed by thawing
.[32][Level of evidence: 3iiiDiii]
Serious toxic effects include bladder outlet injury, urinary incontinence, sexual impotence, and rectal injury.
The technique of cryosurgery is under development.

Stage IV Prostate Cancer
Note: Some citations in the text of this section are followed by a level of evidence.
The PDQ editorial boards use a formal ranking system to help the reader judge the strength of evidence linked to the reported results of a therapeutic strategy.
(Refer to the PDQ summary on Levels of Evidence for more information.)
Stage IV prostate cancer is defined by the following staging systems: * American Joint Committee on Cancer TNM classifications: + T4, N0, M0, any G.
+ Any T, N1, M0, any G.
+ Any T, any N, M1, any G. * Jewett staging system: stage D1 or D2.
Treatment selection depends on age, coexisting medical illnesses, symptoms, and whether distant metastases (most often bone) or only regional lymph node involvement is present.
The most common symptoms originate from the urinary tract or from bone metastases.
Palliation of symptoms from the urinary tract with transurethral resection or radiation therapy and palliation of symptoms from bone metastases with radiation therapy or hormonal therapy are an important part of the management of these patients.
Treatment information for patients whose disease has the following classifications: * AJCC TNM classification: + T4, N0, M0, any G.
+ Any T, N1, M0, any G. * Jewett staging system: D1.
The Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) (now the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality) performed a systematic review of the available randomized, clinical trial evidence comparing radiation therapy to radiation therapy with prolonged androgen suppression performed by its Technology Evaluation Center, an evidence-based Practice Center of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association.[1][Level of evidence: 1iiA]
The meta-analysis found a difference in 5-year overall survival in favor of radiation therapy plus continued androgen suppression, compared to radiation therapy alone (hazard ratio=0.631, 95% CI=0.479-0.831).
This reduction in overall mortality indicates that adjuvant androgen suppression should be initiated at the time of radiation and continued for several years.
The optimal duration of therapy and the issue of utility of neoadjuvant hormonal therapy remain to be determined.
In a small randomized trial of 98 men who underwent radical prostatectomy plus pelvic lymphadenectomy and were found to have nodal metastases (stage T1-2 N1 M0), immediate continuous hormonal therapy with the LHRH agonist goserelin or with orchiectomy was compared to deferred therapy until documentation of disease progression.[2][Level of evidence: 1iA]
At 100 months, the survival rate in the immediate therapy arm was about 80%, versus about 60% for the deferred therapy arm.
Treatment information for patients whose disease has the following classifications: * AJCC TNM classification: Any T, any N, M1, any G. * Jewett staging system: D2.
Hormonal treatment is the mainstay of therapy for distant metastatic (stage D2) prostate cancer.
Cure is rarely, if ever, possible, but striking subjective or objective responses to treatment occur in the majority of patients.
Initial results from a randomized study of immediate hormonal treatment (orchiectomy or LHRH analogue) versus deferred treatment (watchful waiting with hormonal therapy at progression) in men with locally advanced or asymptomatic metastatic prostate cancer showed better overall survival and prostate cancer-specific survival with the immediate treatment.
The incidence of pathologic fractures, spinal cord compression, and ureteric obstruction were also lower in the immediate treatment arm.[4][Level of evidence: 1iiA]
In some series, pretreatment levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) are inversely correlated with progression-free duration in patients with metastatic prostate cancer who receive hormonal therapy.
After hormonal therapy is instituted, reduction of PSA to undetectable levels provides information regarding the duration of progression-free status.
However, decreases in PSA of less than 80% may not be very predictive.[5] Orchiectomy and estrogens yield similar results, and selection of 1 or the other depends on patient preference and the morbidity of expected side effects.
Estrogens are associated with the development or exacerbation of cardiovascular disease, especially in high doses.
Diethylstilbestrol (DES) in a dose of 1 milligram per day is not associated with as frequent cardiovascular complications as higher doses are; however, the use of DES has decreased because of cardiovascular toxic effects and DES is no longer commercially available in the United States.
The psychologic implications of orchiectomy are objectionable to many patients, and many will choose alternative therapy if effective.[6]
Approaches using LHRH agonists and/or antiandrogens in patients with stage IV prostate cancer have produced response rates similar to standard hormonal treatments.[,9]
In a randomized trial, the LHRH analogue leuprolide (1 milligram subcutaneously every day) was found to be as effective as DES (3 milligrams orally every day) in any T, any N, M1 patients, but caused less gynecomastia, nausea/vomiting, and thromboembolisms.[10] In other randomized studies, the depot LHRH analogue goserelin (Zoladex) was found to be as effective as orchiectomy [11-13]
Castration has been shown to be superior to monotherapy with bicalutamide.[14] A small randomized study comparing 1 milligram of DES orally 3 times per day to 250 milligrams of flutamide 3 times per day in patients with metastatic prostate cancer showed similar response rates with both regimens but superior survival with DES.
There was more cardiovascular and/or thromboembolic toxic effects, of borderline statistical significance, associated with the DES treatment.[15][Level of evidence: 1iA]
On the basis that the adrenal glands continue to produce androgens after surgical or medical castration, case series studies were performed in which antiandrogen therapy was added to castration.
Promising results from such case series led to widespread use of the strategy, known as Ã¯Â¿Â½maximal androgen blockageÃ¯Â¿Â½ (MAB) or Ã¯Â¿Â½complete androgen blockade.Ã¯Â¿Â½ However, subsequent randomized controlled trials cast doubt on the efficacy of adding an antiandrogen to castration.
In a large randomized controlled trial comparing treatment with bilateral orchiectomy plus either the antiandrogen flutamide or placebo, there was no difference in overall survival.[16][Level of evidence: 1iA]
When trials of androgen suppression versus androgen suppression plus either nilutamide or flutamide were examined in a subset analysis, the absolute survival rate at 5 years was better for the combined therapy group (2.9% better, 95% CI=0.3%-5.5%).
On the other hand, when trials of androgen suppression versus androgen suppression plus cyproterone acetate were examined, the absolute survival trend at 5 years was worse for the combined therapy group (2.8% worse, 95% CI= -7.6% to +2.0%).[18]
The AHCPR has performed a systematic review of the available randomized, clinical trial evidence of single hormonal therapies and combined androgen blockade performed by its Technology Evaluation Center, an evidence-based Practice Center of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association.
A meta-analysis of randomized trials comparing various hormonal monotherapies in men with stage III or IV prostate cancer (predominantly stage IV) came to the following conclusions: 1.
Overall survival at 2 years using any of the LHRH angonists is similar to treatment with orchiectomy or 3 milligrams per day of DES (hazard ratio=1.26, 95% CI=0.92-1.39).
2.
Survival rates at 2 years are similar or worse with nonsteroidal antiandrogens compared to orchiectomy (hazard ratio=1.22, 95% CI=0.99-1.50).
3.
Treatment withdrawals, used as a surrogate for adverse effects, occurred less with LHRH agonists (0%-4%) than with nonsteroidal antiandrogens (4%-10%).[19][Level of evidence: 1iiA]
Combined androgen blockade was of no greater benefit than single hormonal therapy, with less patient tolerance.
Also, the evidence was judged insufficient to determine whether men newly diagnosed with asymptomatic metastatic disease should have immediate androgen suppression therapy or should have therapy deferred until they have clinical signs or symptoms of progression.[1]
A large proportion of men experience hot flushes after bilateral orchiectomy or treatment with LHRH agonists.
These hot flushes can persist for years.[20] Varying levels of success in the management of these symptoms have been reported with DES, clonidine, cyproterone acetate, or medroxyprogesterone acetate (Megace).
After tumor progression on 1 form of hormonal manipulation develops, an objective tumor response to any other form is uncommon.[21] However, some studies suggest that withdrawal of flutamide (with or without aminoglutethimide administration) may be associated with a decline in PSA values and that one may need to monitor for this response before initiating new therapy.[22-24]
To date, no evidence indicates that chemotherapy prolongs survival.[25] Low-dose prednisone may palliate symptoms in about a third of the cases.[26]
PC-SPES is an herbal combination, stated to contain 8 herbs: chrysanthemum, isatis, licorice, lucid ganoderma, pseudo-ginseng, rubescens, saw palmetto, and scute.
On February 8, 2002 the FDA warned consumers to stop using PC-SPES because analysis by the California Department of Health Services revealed the presence of contamination with undeclared prescription drugs.[27] It is no longer marketed, because the product was found to be adulterated by synthetic compounds.
Although it was marketed as a dietary supplement for Ã¯Â¿Â½prostate health,Ã¯Â¿Â½ it was frequently used with therapeutic intent by prostate cancer patients.
(Ã¯Â¿Â½PCÃ¯Â¿Â½ stood for Ã¯Â¿Â½prostate cancer;Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½SPESÃ¯Â¿Â½ is Latin for Ã¯Â¿Â½hopeÃ¯Â¿Â½).
Several uncontrolled case series showed some clinical activity as manifested by reduction in PSA, as well as loss of libido and sexual potency, gynecomastia, and thromboembolism.[28-30] This led to the hypothesis that its clinical activity could be due to natural or synthetic compounds with estrogenic activity.
Also, a case report of a bleeding diathesis in a man taking PC-SPES led to the documentation that the supplement contained warfarin.[31] A number of lots of PC-SPES manufactured from 1996 to 2001 were therefore assayed.[32]
When recent lots were compared to older ones, there were progressively lower levels of DES and indomethacin and varying levels of natural estrogens and of warfarin.
Standard treatment options: 1.
Hormonal manipulations effectively used as initial therapy for prostate cancer:
[33] a.
Orchiectomy alone or with an androgen blocker.[34]
(DES is no longer commercially available in the United States.)
2.
External-beam irradiation for attempted cure (highly selected stage M0 patients).[37,38] Definitive radiation therapy should be delayed 4 to 6 weeks after transurethral resection to reduce incidence of stricture.[39]
Hormonal therapy should be considered in addition to external-beam irradiation.[1]
Palliative radiation therapy.
Palliative surgery (transurethral resection).
Careful observation without further immediate treatment (in selected patients).
Radical prostatectomy with immediate orchiectomy is under clinical evaluation.[40] An uncontrolled, retrospective review of a large series of patients with any T, N1-3, M0 disease treated at the Mayo Clinic by concurrent radical prostatectomy and orchiectomy showed prolongation of intervals to local and distant progression.
However, a significant increase in survival has not been demonstrated.
Systemic chemotherapy for hormone-refractory disease is under clinical evaluation.[25,41,42]

Recurrent Prostate Cancer
In prostate cancer, the selection of further treatment depends on many factors, including previous treatment, site of recurrence, coexistent illnesses, and individual patient considerations.
Definitive radiation therapy can be given to patients who fail only locally following prostatectomy.[1-4]
An occasional patient can be salvaged with prostatectomy after a local recurrence following definitive radiation therapy
.[5] However, only about 10% of patients treated initially with radiation will have local relapse only.
In these patients, prolonged disease control is often possible with hormonal therapy, with median cancer-specific survival of 6 years after local failure.[6] Cryosurgical ablation of recurrence following radiation is associated frequently with elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and a high complication rate.
This technique is still undergoing clinical evaluation.[7] Most relapsing patients who initially received locoregional therapy with surgery or irradiation will fail with disseminated disease and are managed with hormonal therapy.
The management of these patients with stage IV disease is discussed in the preceding section.
Palliative radiation therapy for bone pain can be very useful.
Because of the poor prognosis in prostate cancer patients with relapsing or progressive disease after hormonal therapy, clinical trials are appropriate.
These include phase I and II trials of new chemotherapeutic or biologic agents.
Even among patients with metastatic Ã¯Â¿Â½hormone-refractory prostate cancer,Ã¯Â¿Â½ there is some heterogeneity in prognosis and in retained hormone sensitivity.
In such patients who have symptomatic bone disease, several factors are associated with worsened prognosis: poor performance status, elevated alkaline phosphatase, abnormal serum creatinine, and short (
Aminoglutethimide, hydrocortisone, flutamide withdrawal, progesterone, ketoconazole, and combinations of these therapies have produced PSA responses in 14% to 60% of patients treated and have also produced clinical responses of 0% to 25% when assessed.
The duration of these PSA responses has been in the range of 2 to 4 months.[10] Data on whether PSA changes while on chemotherapy are predictive of survival are conflicting.[9,11]
Patients treated with either luteinizing hormone agonists or estrogens as primary therapy are generally maintained with castrate levels of testosterone.
One study from the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group showed that a superior survival resulted when patients were maintained on primary androgen deprivation.[12] However, another study from the Southwest Oncology Group did not show an advantage to continued androgen blockade.[13]
Painful bone metastases can be a major problem in prostate cancer.
Many strategies have been studied for palliation, including pain medication, radiation, corticosteroids, bone-seeking radionuclides, gallium nitrate, and bisphosphonates.[14] External-beam radiation therapy for palliation of bone pain can be very useful.
Also, the use of radioisotopes such as strontium-89 has been shown to be effective as palliative treatment of some patients with osteoblastic metastases.
When this isotope is given alone, it has been reported to decrease bone pain in 80% of patients treated [15] and is similar to responses with local or hemibody radiation.[16]
Chemotherapy has been reported to provide palliative benefit to some men with hormone-refractory disease.
Ongoing clinical trials continue to explore the value of chemotherapy for these patients.[18-25] Low-dose prednisone may palliate symptoms in some patients.[26]
A randomized trial showed improved pain control in hormone-resistant patients treated with mitoxantrone plus prednisone compared with those treated with prednisone alone.[22] There were no statistically significant differences in overall survival or measured global quality of life between the 2 treatments.
Other chemotherapy regimens reported to produce subjective improvement in symptoms and reduction in PSA level include the following: docetaxel, paclitaxel, estramustine/docetaxel, estramustine/etoposide, estramustine/vinblastine, and estramustine/paclitaxel.[23][Level of evidence: 3iiiDii]
See Stage IV section of this summary for a discussion of PC-SPES, an herbal supplement taken off of the market after it was discovered to be adulterated.
Currently, no chemotherapy regimen can be considered standard.
Patients should be encouraged to receive treatment on a clinical trial.
