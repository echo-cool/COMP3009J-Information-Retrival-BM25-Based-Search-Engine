ISSUES ANNOUNCED BY THE COURT Return to Table of Contents
I. Whether the district court erroneously instructed the jury regarding the elements of the crime of possession of one thousand grams or more of a controlled substance with intent to distribute, and if the court of appeals erroneously concluded that the prosecution was not required to prove that petitioner knowingly possessed such amount to trigger an enhanced sentence?
II.
Whether the district court erroneously treated petitioner's special offender charge as a "sentence enhancer" rather than as a substantive offense or as an element of the possession with the intent to distribute charge, and if the court of appeals incorrectly relied on People v. Ramirez to determine that the prosecution need not prove mens rea with respect to that charge?
STATEMENT OF THE CASE Return to Table of Contents
On January 21, 1998, the district attorney filed an information in the Mesa County district court charging Mr. Whitaker with importation of a schedule II controlled substance[1], possession of over one thousand grams of a schedule II controlled substance with intent to distribute[2]
Mr. Whitaker was tried at a jury trial on the charges of possession of over a thousand grams of a schedule II controlled substance with intent to distribute and introduction, distribution or importation of a schedule II controlled substance and found guilty.(v1,p84) The charges of possession of a schedule II controlled substance with intent to distribute and possession of drug paraphernalia were dismissed by the prosecutor.(PSIR,p1; minute order 8/18/98) On September 30, 1998, the district court sentenced Mr. Whitaker to 20 years in the state prison.(v5,p70) On November 16, 1998, Mr. Whitaker filed a notice of appeal in the Court of Appeals, thereby perfecting his right to appeal.(flat file) On September 14, 2000, the Court of Appeals issued an opinion affirming Mr. Whitaker's conviction and sentence.

STATEMENT OF THE FACTS Return to Table of Contents
On January 14, 1998, Grand Junction Police Department officers boarded a Denver-bound Greyhound bus as part of a "narcotics and weapons interdiction program."(v4,p140) At the Grand Junction bus depot, all passengers were "off-loaded", the bus was serviced and then the passengers re-boarded the bus.(v4,p141) At this point, three police officers boarded the bus, identified themselves as law enforcement and informed the passengers that they were going to talk to each and every passenger, if that was all right with them.(v4,p142) One officer remained near the door at the front of the bus while the other two officers went to the rear of the bus and talked to passengers.(v4,p141-142)
During this procedure, the officers talked to David Whitaker.(v4,p145) The officers testified that Mr. Whitaker was nervous while speaking to the officers.(v4,p144-145) Mr. Whitaker, responding to questions from the officers, indicated that he did not have any bags on the bus.(v4,p146) Officers pointed to a black bag near Mr. Whitaker and asked if that was his luggage.(v4,p150) Mr. Whitaker indicated that it was not his bag, but that he had put some of his things in the bag because it did not appear that anyone was using it.(v4,p172-174) Officers searched the bag and found several duct tape covered packages in the bottom of the bag.(v4,p180) The officers cut open the packages and found a substance later identified as methamphetamine.(v4,p184)
At trial, Mr. Whitaker continued to maintain that although he had put a few small items into the bag, the packages of drugs were not his and he did not know that they were in the bag.(v4, p133-135)
ARGUMENT
I. Conviction and sentencing for possession of over one thousand grams of a controlled substance under C.R.S. Â§ 18-18-405 requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt and a jury finding that the defendant knew he possessed over one thousand grams of the controlled substance.
Return to Table of Contents
The district court erroneously instructed the jury regarding the elements of possession of one thousand grams or more of a controlled substance with the intent to distribute.
The elemental instruction failed to convey that the mens rea of knowingly applied to all elements of the crime, including possession of over one thousand grams.
This error violated Mr. Whitaker's right to jury trial and due process rights because the jury was not required to find that he acted with the requisite culpable mental state with respect to the quantity of controlled substance.
A.
The District Court's Jury Instruction Return to Table of Contents
The district court instructed the jurors in instruction number 11:
The elements of the crime of Possession of 1000 Grams or More of a Controlled Substance with Intent to Distribute are:
1.
That the defendant,
2.
in the State of Colorado, at or about the date and place charged,
3.
knowingly or intentionally,
4.
possessed with intent to distribute with or without remuneration,
5.
the controlled substance methamphetamine,
6.
and the controlled substance possessed by the defendant weighed one thousand grams or more.
. . .
(v1,p80) (emphasis added) Defense counsel did not object to the instruction.
B. Argument.
1.
Section 18-18-405 and COLJI acknowledge drug quantity as elemental to the crime of possession with intent to distribute, and the requisite mental state applies to it Return to Table of Contents
Section 18-1-503(4) provides:
When a statute defining an offense prescribes as an element thereof a specified culpable mental state, that mental state is deemed to apply to every element of the offense unless an intent to limit its application clearly appears.
(emphasis added).
The district court's instruction is incorrect.
It does not require the jury to find that Mr. Whitaker knowingly possessed over one thousand grams of a schedule II controlled substance.
It separates the element defining the quantity of controlled substance from the mens rea element.
It deviates from the pattern COLJI instruction because it includes the word "and" before the sixth element and therefore does not require the jury to find that Mr. Whitaker knowingly possessed a controlled substance weighing over one thousand grams.
This offense is defined in section 18-18-405, 6 C.R.S. (1998) as follows:
(1)(a). . .
it is unlawful for any person knowingly . . . possess with intent to . . . distribute a controlled substance.
. .
. . .
(2) . . . any person who violates any of the provisions of subsection (1) of this section:
(a) In the case of a controlled substance listed in schedule I or II of part 2 of this article, commits:
(I) A class 3 felony; except that a person commits a class 4 felony if such violation is based on the possession of a controlled substance listed in schedule II unless otherwise provided in paragraph (a) of subsection (3) of this section;
. . .
(3)(a) Except as otherwise provided in section 18-18-407 relating to special offenders, any person convicted pursuant to paragraph (a) of subsection (2) of this section for knowingly . . . possessing with intent to . . . distribute . . .
an amount that is or has been represented to be:
. . .
(III) One thousand grams or one kilogram or more of any material compound, mixture, or preparation that contains a schedule I or schedule II controlled substance as listed in section 18-18-203 or 18-18-204 shall be sentenced to the department of correction for a term greater than the maximum presumptive range but not more than twice the maximum presumptive range provided for such offense in section 18-1-105(1)(a).
The Colorado pattern jury instructions do not include a jury instruction for the statute in its current form, but they do contain a model instruction for the similarly constructed precursor to this statute:

The notes for use following this pattern instruction refer to Section 18-18-105, which was the previous codification of the 1998 version of Â§18-18-405.
Section 18-18-105, 8B C.R.S. (Supp. 1986).
The pertinent part of Â§18-18-105 read:
[A]ny person convicted pursuant to paragraph (a) of subsection (2) of this section for knowingly or intentionally manufacturing, dispensing, selling, or distributing, with or without remuneration, or possessing with intent to manufacture, dispense, sell or distribute, with or without remuneration, twenty-eight grams or more of any material compound, mixture, or preparation which contains cocaine, as defined in section 12-22-303(6.5), C.R.S.; or inducing, attempting to induce, or conspiring with one or more other persons to manufacture, dispense, sell, or distribute, with or without remuneration, or possessing with intent to manufacture, dispense, sell, or distribute, with or without remuneration, twenty-eight grams or more of any material, compound, mixture, or preparation which contains cocaine, as defined in section 12-22-303(6.5), C.R.S., shall be sentenced to at least the minimum term of incarceration in the presumptive range provided for such offense in section 18-1-105(1)(a) and, in addition to any other penalty upon conviction shall be fined not less than one thousand dollars but not more than five hundred thousand dollars.
This statute is substantially similar in language to the 1998 version of Â§18-18-405, although the 1998 statute distinguishes between three different weights of drugs and expands the statute to include all schedule I and II substances, not just cocaine[5].

The mens rea element remained constant throughout the amendments and was never modified.
Therefore, the elemental jury instruction given in Mr. Whitaker's case should have tracked the language of 36:16.
Indeed, although the content of a Colorado Jury Instruction is not legally definitive, its long and common usage is persuasive on the matter of being a correct summary of the law.

Even assuming, arguedo, that section 18-18-405 itself does not mandate that drug quantity be treated as an element to which mens rea attaches, a defendant's rights to due process and trial by jury do so mandate.

a.
This Court and the Court of Appeals have ruled that possession of certain amounts of schedule II controlled substances under Â§ 18-18-405, and "special offender" under Â§ 18-18-407, are not elements of offenses, but are sentence enhancing circumstances, and thus do not require proof of a culpable mens rea.
Return to Table of Contents
In Vega v. People, 893 P.2d 107 (Colo. 1995), this Court ruled that Â§ 18-18-407(1), special offender," is not an offense, but is a sentence enhancer.
Likewise, in People v. Salcedo, 985 P.2d 7, 14 (Colo.
App. 1998), rev'd on other grounds, ___ P.2d ___ (Colo.
No. 98SC500, May 1, 2000), and People v. Ramirez, 997 P.2d 1200, 1205 (Colo.
App. 1999), aff'd by operation of law, No. 99SC814, ___ P.3d ___ (Colo. Sept. 17, 2001), the Court of Appeals ruled that Â§ 18-18-405(3)(a), possession of over twenty-eight grams of cocaine, in not an offense but is a mandatory sentencing provision.
Now, in this case, the Court of Appeals has concluded that, under Â§ 18-18-405, possession of over one thousand grams of methamphetamine, is not an offense, but is a "sentence-enhancing circumstance."[6] (See Opinion, p12) The State consistently relies on this distinction to argue to courts and juries that it is not required to prove mens rea when it comes to mere "sentence-enhancing circumstances."
See, e.g., Ramirez, 997 P.2d at 1204 (describing the trial court "instructing the jury that it could find [defendant] was a special offender on the ground of possession of 100 pounds or more of marihuana without having to determine whether she knew the amount of marijuana possessed").
b. "Sentencing Factors" v. "Elements" under Vega, and the new rule of Jones and Apprendi Return to Table of Contents
Because the State has argued that "drug quantity" and "special offender" are both sentence-enhancing circumstances, as opposed to elements, the following discussion applies equally to the drug quantity issue and to Mr. Whitaker's special offender charge argued in Issue II of this brief.
In Vega v. People, 893 P.2d 107, 111 (Colo. 1995), this Court classified the special offender provision addressing the introduction, distribution, or importation of a controlled substance into the state of Colorado, under 18-18-407(1), as merely a sentence enhancing provision and not an element of a substantive offense.
Based on this distinction, this Court determined that the special offender provision deserved some, but not all of the due process protections afforded to substantive elements.
The Vega decision acknowledged that Colorado has engrafted some procedural protections onto the sentence enhancing statutes, i.e., notice and an opportunity for a hearing on the existence of "sentence enhancing factors."
Id. at 116 (citing People v. Lacey, 723 P.2d 111, 113 (Colo. 1986)); see also Armintrout v. People, 864 P.2d 576 (Colo. 1993) (a factor enhancing a sentence must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt).
Thus, in Vega, this Court determined that the defendant's due process rights were protected when he received notice of the possibility of sentence enhancement under the special offender statute through separate charges, a special jury verdict on the question of importation, a jury verdict on the question of importation, and a jury instruction requiring the jury to find the element of importation "beyond a reasonable doubt."
Id. at 117.
The defendant in Vega, however, was not entitled to assert an affirmative defense, because this Court concluded that affirmative defenses do not apply to mere sentencing factors.
This holding implies that the defendant's mental culpability was not at issue with regard to the "circumstance" of importation.
After Vega was decided, the United States Supreme Court decided Jones v. United States, 526 U.S. 227 (1999).
In Jones, the Court concluded that a federal carjacking statute defined three distinct offenses, as opposed to a single crime with a choice of three maximum penalites with two of them dependent on sentencing factors exempt from the requirements of charge and a jury verdict.
The Court stated, "Much turns on the determination that a fact is an element of an offense rather than a sentencing consideration, given that elements must be charged in the indictment, submitted to a jury, and proven by the Government beyond a reasonable doubt."
Jones, 526 U.S. at 232.
The Court concluded that the "look" of a statute was not a reliable guide in determining whether the specification of facts that substantially increased a penalty range was meant to carry none of the due process safeguards that elements of an offense bring with them for a defendant's benefit.
Jones, 526 U.S. at 233.
The Court rejected the government's arguments that the structure and parsing of words within the statute suggested that the additional factual determinations were not meant to carry due process protections.
Id. at 234-35.
Instead, the Court looked to the nature of the additional fact (which in Jones's case was whether "serious bodily injury" occurred) to determine whether it was the type of factual determination that deserved due process protections.[7] The Court concluded that to construe the additional fact provisions as mere sentence enhancing factors, instead of elements, would leave the statute "open to constitutional doubt" on due process grounds.
Id. at 240.
The Court in Jones also engaged in a historical analysis of the series of cases decided over the past quarter century dealing with due process and the guarantee of trial by jury.
The Court recalled Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U.S. 684 (1975), in which it rejected the State's argument that the element of malice in a murder statute was simply a fact to be determined at sentencing, and any rebuttal based on heat of passion was merely a sentencing consideration.
The Court recalled that the Mullaney decision "declined to accord the State this license to recharacterize the issue, . . . in part because an unlimited choice over characterizing a stated fact as an element [or not] would leave the State substantially free to manipulate its way out of Winship."[8]
The Court in Jones also recalled Patterson v. New York, 432 U.S. 197 (1977), which held that the State lacked discretion to omit "traditional" elements from the definition of crimes and instead to require the accused to disprove such elements.
Jones, 526 U.S. at 241-42.
The Jones Court then acknowledged that these cases about allocation of burden were succeeded by McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U.S. 79 (1986), which rejected the defendant's argument that he was entitled to a jury determination of proof beyond a reasonable doubt of a fact that did not expose him to a sentence beyond the maximum that the statute otherwise set without reference to that fact.[9] Jones, 526 at 242.
The McMillan decision, then, left open the question of whether a judicial factfinding by a preponderance satisfies constitutional requirements under "both the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the jury guarantee of the Sixth" when the application of that finding increases the potential severity of the penalty for a variant of a given crime.
Jones, 526 U.S. at 242.
The Jones decision answered that question by holding that, "under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and the notice and jury trial guarantees of the Sixth Amendment, any fact (other than prior conviction)[10] that increases the maximum penalty for a crime must be charged in an indictment, submitted to a jury, and proven beyond a reasonable doubt."
Jones, 526 U.S. at fn. 6.
The Jones Court stated that its constitutional analysis concerned the required procedures for finding the facts that determine the maximum permissible punishment--the safeguards going to "the formality of notice, the identity of the factfinder, and the burden of proof."
Id.
Thus, Supreme Court jurisprudence from the last quarter century, spanning from Mullaney to Jones, suggests that the Court is concerned with government attempts to lessen the factfinder's burden of proof when it comes to certain "facts" characterized as sentence enhancers as opposed to elements, explicitly including situations in which those "facts" presume, determine, or otherwise involve a defendant's culpable mental state.
In Mullaney, the Court explicitly rejected the State's attempt to characterize the "fact" of whether the defendant acted out of malice or heat of passion as a sentencing consideration as opposed to an element of the homicide crime.
The Court invalidated the Maine statute at issue because it presumed that a defendant who acted with intent to kill possessed the "malice aforethought" necessary to constitute the State's murder offense (and therefore, was subject to that crime's associated punishment of life imprisonment).
The Court acknowledged, therefore, that a factor involving the defendant's mens rea could not be divorced from elements and relegated to the position of a mere sentencing consideration.
Then, in Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000), the Supreme Court reaffirmed the idea that "facts" requiring a culpable mental state on the part of the defendant must be submitted to the jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.
In Apprendi, the Court reversed the defendant's "enhanced" sentence and invalidated a New Jersey statute because the statute allowed a jury to convict the defendant of a second-degree offense on its finding beyond a reasonable doubt, and then allowed a judge to impose punishment identical to that New Jersey provided for first-degree crimes on his finding, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant's purpose was to intimidate his victim based on the victim's racial characteristic.
530 U.S. at 491-92.
The Apprendi Court observed that, by its very terms, the New Jersey statute mandated "an examination of the defendant's state of mind - a concept known well to the criminal law as the defendant's mens rea." Id. at 492.
The Court also found that it made no difference that the statute contained a separate mens rea requirement in the statute under which the jury delivered its verdict.
The Court stated that "[a] second mens rea requirement hardly defeats the reality that the enhancement statute imposes of its own force an intent requirement necessary for the imposition of sentence."
Id. at 492-94.
The Court observed that the defendant's intent in committing a crime "is perhaps as close as one might hope to come to a core criminal `element.'"
Id. at 493.
Despite the "clear `elemental' nature" of the mental state factor, however, the Court clarified that the relevant inquiry is one not of form, but of effect -whether the required finding exposes the defendant to a greater punishment than that authorized by the jury's guilty verdict.
Id. at 494.
Thus, in Apprendi, the Court reaffirmed the principle that "criminal law is concerned not only with guilt or innocence in the abstract, but also with the degree of criminal culpability assessed."
Id at 485.
And, due process is concerned as much with the category of substantive offenses as with the degree of criminal culpability assessed.
Id. at 494-95 (recognizing that the effect of New Jersey's sentencing "enhancement" was unquestionably to turn a second-degree offense into a first-degree offense, under the State's own criminal code).
The Apprendi Court acknowledged that "[t]he degree of criminal culpability the legislature chooses to associate with particular, factually distinct conduct has significant implications both for a defendant's very liberty, and for the heightened stigma associated with an offense the legislature has selected as worthy of greater punishment."
Id. at 495.
Thus, the Court concluded that merely because the state legislature placed its sentence "enhancer" within the sentencing provisions of the criminal code does not mean that the finding of a particular mens rea on the part of the defendant was not an essential element of the offense.
The mere presence of an "enhancement" in a sentencing statute does not define its character.
Id. at 495-96.
Here, the State's practice of divorcing the jury determinations of "drug quantity" and "importation" from the mens rea element in the crime of possession, effectively allows the prosecution to escape the due process and jury trial requirements that adhere to other criminal elements, i.e., proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant acted with a particular culpable mental state.
This case exemplifies the converse of the situation in Apprendi.
In Apprendi, the State attempted to divorce a finding of culpable mental state from the facts that the jury was required to find to render a guilty verdict.
Here, the jury made a finding on Mr. Whitaker's culpable mental state with respect to the crime of possession in its basic form, but was allowed to divorce the "sentence-enhancing" facts from the mens rea element.
Thus, the jury was not required to make a finding on whether Mr. Whitaker acted with that same mens rea with respect to the quantity of drugs at issue or the importation element.
This practice is unconstitutional.
The holdings of Jones and Apprendi mandate that any fact that increases the defendant's permissible sentence beyond the range authorized by the jury's verdict must be afforded the same due process protections as an "element" of the offense, no matter what you call that fact.
The right to trial by jury guarantees that the jury will make all findings, including culpable mental state, beyond a reasonable doubt.

c. Post-Apprendi interpretations of the "drug quantity" element Return to Table of Contents
Before Apprendi was decided, many federal appellate courts treated drug quantity levels as a mere sentencing factor that was not required to be pled in the indictment and proved to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.
For example, in United States v. Jones, 194 F.3d 1178, 1183-86 (10^th Cir. 1999) (hereinafter "Carless Jones I") the Tenth Circuit affirmed a defendant's enhanced sentence based on drug quantity, although no specific quantity was pled in the indictment.
As late as November of 1999, the Tenth Circuit interpreted drug quantity as a "sentencing provision" independent of the substantive offense to which it applied.
Id.
Carless Jones' motion petitioning for certiorari to the United States Supreme Court was pending when Apprendi was decided.
The Supreme Court granted certiorari, vacated the judgment in Carless Jones I, and remanded to the Tenth Circuit for "further consideration" in light of Apprendi.
Jones v. United States, 530 U.S. 1271 (2000).
On remand from the Supreme Court, the Tenth Circuit reversed Mr. Jones' sentence, holding that the quantity of drugs is an "essential element" of the offense if it exposes the defendant to a heightened maximum sentence, and the trial court's failure to treat drug quantity as an element at trial was prejudicial.
United States v. Jones, 235 F.3d 1231, 1236-38 (10^th Cir. 2000) (hereinafter "Carless Jones II").
In Carless Jones II, the Tenth Circuit explained its departure from its pre-Apprendi practice of failing to afford certain due process and right to jury trial protections to facts classified as sentencing factors.
The Court explained that its pre-Apprendi precedent interpreted the drug quantity provision as setting forth applicable sentencing ranges, separate and distinct from the elements of the substantive offense of possession with intent to distribute.
235 F.3d at 1234-35.
The Tenth Circuit interpreted the new rule of Apprendi as, "[p]ut simply, facts that expose a defendant to a punishment greater than that otherwise legally prescribed were by definition `elements' of a separate legal offense."
Id. at 1236.
The Tenth Circuit acknowledged that many sister circuits had reached similar conclusions.
Id. at 1233, fn.[11]
Thus, the Court concluded that "the quantity of drugs involved in a violation of Â§ 841 is an essential element of the offense if that fact exposes the defendant to a heightened maximum sentence under [21 U.S.C.] Â§ 841(b)(1)(A) or (B)."
Id. at 1236.
The Tenth Circuit also concluded that the violation of Carless Jones' constitutional rights was not harmless.
Id. at 1234.
The Court found that, even if the district court could have achieved the same sentence by imposing sentence in a different, legal way, the Court was concerned with the legality of the sentence actually imposed, regardless of whether it was less severe than a sentence the sentencing court could have imposed by other legal means.
Id. at 1238.
The Tenth Circuit recalled that it has "regularly found reversible error when the sentence imposed by the district court exceeded the statutory maximum penalty applicable to the offense of conviction."
Id.
The Court vacated the sentence and remanded for imposition of a new "unenhanced" sentence, finding that Mr. Jones' enhanced sentence was beyond that authorized by the jury's verdict.
Id.
Although not necessarily binding on this Court, the Tenth Circuit's post-Apprendi interpretation of "drug quantity" as an essential element rather than a mere sentencing factor should be viewed as persuasive, especially considering that the United States Supreme Court rejected the opinion issued in Carless Jones I.
d.
The instructional error requires that Mr. Whitaker's conviction be reversed and his sentence vacated.
Return to Table of Contents
The district court's instruction created structural error because it omitted an "essential element" of an offense and deprived him of a jury finding of whether he knowingly possessed over 1000 grams of a controlled substance.
Therefore, conviction for possession of over 1000 grams of a controlled substance must be reversed and his sentence must be vacated.

People, 973 P.2d 1234 (Colo. 1999); Chambers v. People, 682 P.2d 1173 (Colo. 1984).
In Cooper, this Court found structural error where the district court failed to instruct the jury accurately on the intent element required for burglary.
Here, the district court's instruction permitted Mr. Whitaker's jury to find him guilty of the crime even if he did not knowingly possess over 1000 grams of the controlled substance.
The quantity of controlled substance involved is an essential element of this drug statute.
(See arguments above) The pattern jury instruction recognizes the quantity element and correctly instructs the jury.
Following a similar format would have eliminated the harm in this case.
The consequences of a structural defect are "necessarily unquantifiable and indeterminate, thus rendering the entire trial fundamentally unfair and warranting automatic reversal."
Sullivan v. Louisiana, 508 U.S. 275, 279 (1993); Bogdanov v. People, 941 P.2d 247, 253 (Colo. 1997).
Thus, structural defects preclude harmless error analysis.
Id.
The Court need not decide whether the error is structural or subject to constitutional harmless error review, however, because the error clearly is not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.
People v. Vance, 933 P.2d 576 (Colo. 1997), Bogdanov v. People, 941 P.2d 247 (Colo. 1997); Cooper, supra; Neder v. United States, __ U.S. __ 119 S.Ct. 1827 (1999).
The effect of the trial court's error concerning the "drug quantity" element was that it exposed Mr. Whitaker to a higher sentencing range than that otherwise authorized by the jury verdict in this case.
For the quantity of controlled substance at issue here, Â§ 18-18-405(3)(a)(III) calls for a sentence of "greater than the maximum presumptive range but no more than twice the maximum presumptive range."
This provision increased Mr. Whitaker's possible sentencing range from four to sixteen years (the presumptive range for a class three felony, extraordinary risk crime) to sixteen (and a day) to 32 years.
See Â§ 18-1-105, C.R.S (1998).
Mr. Whitaker received a twenty year sentence, which obviously exceeded the sentence authorized by the jury's verdict if one disregards the drug quantity element.
Therefore, Mr. Whitaker's conviction for possession of more than 1000 grams of methamphetamine with intent to distribute must be reversed and his sentence must be vacated.
Assuming, arguendo, however, that the quantity element can be severed from Mr. Whitaker's conviction for possession with intent to distribute charge, allowing that conviction to stand, then his enhanced sentence must be vacated and remanded to the district court for resentencing within the presumptive range for the class three felony.

Conviction and sentencing for the introduction, distribution, or importation of any controlled substance into the state of Colorado under C.R.S. Â§ 18-18-407 ("special offender") requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt and a jury finding that the defendant knowingly introduced, distributed, or imported such controlled substance into the state of Colorado.
Return to Table of Contents
The district court erroneously treated the special offender charge as a sentence enhancer instead of as a separate substantive offense or as an element of possession with intent to distribute.
As a result, the district court did not require the district attorney to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Whitaker knowingly introduced, distributed, or imported a controlled substance into Colorado.
This violated Mr. Whitaker's rights to due process and to jury trial under both the Colorado and United States Constitutions.

The court of appeals erroneously relied on People v. Ramirez, 997 P.2d 1200, 1205 (Colo.
App. 1999), aff'd by operation of law, No. 99SC814, ___ P.3d ___ (Colo. Sept. 17, 2001), to conclude that "special offender," is not an offense, but is merely a sentence enhancer not to be afforded the same the due process and right to jury trial protections as elements.
The special offender charge required proof of additional facts beyond those necessary to prove possession of over one thousand grams with intent to distribute.
The special offender charge required a finding that Mr. Whitaker introduced, distributed or imported a schedule II controlled substance into the State of Colorado, pursuant to Â§ 18-18-407(1)(d), C.R.S. (1998).
This element is distinct and in addition to the elements submitted for possession of over one thousand grams of a schedule II controlled substance with intent to distribute.
The district court treated the special offender charge as a separate crime up until submission of the instructions to the jury.
Count I of the information contained a special offender charge.
(v1,p9) The district court, instead of giving a separate elemental instruction, submitted an interrogatory on whether Mr. Whitaker had introduced, distributed or imported the controlled substance beyond a reasonable doubt.
(v1,p84) However, the district court did not require the jury to find that Mr. Whitaker had any culpable mental state for the crime.
The appropriate mens rea for this offense is knowingly because the statute does not specify a mental state.
"Although no culpable mental state is expressly designated in a statute defining an offense, a culpable mental state may nevertheless be required for the commission of that offense."
Section 18-1-503(2), 6 C.R.S. (1998).
When a statute is silent as to the culpable mental state, a culpable mental state of "knowingly" will generally apply.

The new rule of Jones and Apprendi Return to Table of Contents
For the same reasons that the new rule set forth in Jones and Apprendi governs Issue I, it is also dispositive of this issue.
See Argument in this Brief, Part I (B)(2)(b)(c) 
Because the additional element of importation exposed Mr. Whitaker to a sentencing range beyond that authorized by the jury's verdict on the possession charge, the importation "circumstance" must be treated as elemental for due process and right to jury trial purposes.
Thus, conviction and sentencing for the introduction, distribution, or importation of any controlled substance into the state of Colorado under C.R.S. Â§ 18-18-407 ("special offender") requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt and a jury finding that the defendant knowingly introduced, distributed, or imported such controlled substance into the state of Colorado.
B.
In addition to the new rule of Jones and Apprendi, the legislative history of the Controlled Substances Act demonstrates a clear intent that a knowing mens rea would apply wherever the Act is silent, including the special offender provision.

Special Offender was enacted in 1981 as part of House Bill 1405, the Uniform Controlled Substances Act.
Colo.
Sess.
Laws 1981, ch. 128, Â§18-18-107(1)(d) at 732.[12]
The provision was added to the Bill by amendment during its consideration in the House Judiciary Committee.
Hearing on H.B. 1405 Before the House Judiciary Committee, 53rd Gen. Assembly, 1st Reg. Sess.
(Audio Tape M1T-81, 18A, March 10, 1981 at 10:40 a.m.).
At the first hearing on March 5, 1981, several law enforcement witnesses suggested the amendment.
(Audio Tape M1T-81, 17A, March 5, 1981 at 3:00 p.m., 3:11 p.m., 3:54 p.m., and 4:07 p.m.).
One of these witnesses, Denver Deputy District Attorney Jim Weissman, also testified that it should be made clear that the mens rea knowingly should apply "across the board" in the Act, because "that's what we're concerned with--people that knowingly violate the drug laws."
(Audio Tape M1T-81, 17A, March 5, 1981 at 3:04-3:05 p.m.).
Jefferson County Chief Deputy District Attorney Joseph Mackey agreed that the culpable mental state knowingly should apply throughout the Act.
(Audio Tape M1T-81, 17A, March 5, 1981 at 4:07).
Both witnesses urged the addition of "knowingly" throughout the Controlled Substances Act at the same time they urged the addition of a special offender provision to the Act.
Neither suggested the mens rea knowingly would not apply to special offender.
See People v. Hickman, __ P.2d __ (Colo.
No. 98SA29, November 8, 1999) (relying in part on district attorney's comments in the legislative history of an amendment to the statute in finding that the retaliation against a victim or witness statute requires intentional conduct, even though the General Assembly deleted the word "intentionally" from the statute).
At the second hearing, on March 10, 1981, the amendment adding special offender was passed at 10:51 a.m.
Eleven minutes later, a representative from the legislative drafting office passed out an amendment drafted in response to the March 5 consensus about mens rea, and said "the amendment you have inserts knowingly throughout" the Act.
The drafter noted that he initially did not add knowingly in one place, a provision dealing with public consumption and display, because he was not sure whether knowingly should be inserted before one or both verbs.
(Audio Tape M1T-81, 18A, March 10, 1981 at 11:28, 11:32-34).
In response, Representative Eberly noted that the appellate courts always read "knowingly" into the criminal statutes when there is no mens rea, and suggested it was not necessary to add the language to each and every provision.
(Audio Tape M1T-81, 18A, March 10, 1981 at 11:29).
Representative Skaggs concurred, and said the amendment was both unnecessary and confusing because it introduced things that "a court is going to insist upon as an element anyway."[13] (Audio Tape M1T-81, 18A, March 10, 1981 at 11:36).
The amendment was then voted down.
No one said anything about special offender, which had been passed only minutes before, being an exception to this rule.
The discussion demonstrates that the legislators intended that "knowingly" would be implied in the Act wherever there was no mens rea written in.
The legislative history also shows that the General Assembly intended a high standard of proof, and expected the provision to be charged very infrequently in the cases of individuals who deal drugs on a very large scale.[14] Sponsor Mielke thought Special Offender would entail little or no fiscal impact, since the provision targets a small number of specially defined dealers; he believed there would be one or two people convicted of special offender per year.
An unidentified representative agreed with this estimate.
Joseph Mackey of the District Attorney's Council agreed that law enforcement would only make out a few Special Offender cases in a given year.
Representative Mielke again said law enforcement might find one or two Special Offenders per year.
(Audio Tape M1T-81, 18A, March 10, 1981 at 10:43-44, 10:46, 10:49 a.m.).
No one ever disagreed with this repeated sentiment.
Assistant Attorney General Pautler volunteered that it would be a worthwhile "burden" to prove Special Offender, and Detective Petrafeso assumed that proof of special offender would require the DA to show that a person was making a living through selling drugs.
(Audio Tape M1T-81, 17A, March 5, 1981 at 3:12-14, 3:59 p.m.).
Requiring knowledge of the fact that would make a person a special offender is consistent with the intent that only the most culpable drug dealers receive exceptional punishment as special offenders.
C. Absent a clear legislative intent to the contrary, courts must presume that conduct punished as criminal includes a culpable mental state.
Here, not only is there no indication that the legislature intended special offender to be strict liability, but the legislative history affirmatively establishes an intent that a knowing mens rea applies throughout the Controlled Substances Act wherever it is silent as to mens rea.

"The contention that an injury can amount to a crime only when inflicted by intention...is as universal and persistent in mature systems of law as belief in freedom of the human will and a consequent ability and duty of the normal individual to choose between good and evil."

A culpable mental state is presumed to apply not only to prohibited conduct, but also to any additional circumstances that make the conduct criminal.
See Morissette, 342 U.S. at 271 (a knowing conversion requires more than defendant's knowledge that he took the property; it also requires knowledge of the fact that made the taking a conversion--that the property belonged to the government); Liparota, 471 U.S. at 425 (defendant must have knowledge that his use of food stamps was unlawful); Theel, 180 Colo. 348, 505 P.2d 964 (possession of marijuana conviction requires understanding of nature of substance possessed); Gross, 830 P.2d 933 (possession of weapon by a previous offender requires proof defendant had knife, and viewed it as a weapon); Div.

App. 1985) (procuring benefits through false representation requires a knowing statement and knowledge that the statement is false).
Mr. Whitaker must be given the benefit of the presumption of a culpable mental state regardless of whether special offender is called an offense or a sentence enhancer.
Mr. Whitaker's conviction for possession was a class three felony, (extraordinary risk crime) carrying a presumptive sentencing range of four to sixteen years.
See Â§18-1-105, C.R.S. (1998).
The effect of a special offender conviction from 1998 was to "require the court to sentence the defendant to a term of at least the minimum term of years within the presumptive range for a class 2 felony but not more than twice the maximum term of years within the presumptive range for a class 2 felony...," i.e., eight to forty-eight years in prison.
Â§ 18-18-407 (1), C.R.S. (1998).
Mr. Whitaker was only nineteen years old at the time he allegedly committed this offense.
This was his first adult felony conviction.
Without the special offender conviction (and the mandatory sentence under Â§ 18-18-405) he may have been a candidate for probation.
Special offender changed the nature of Mr. Whitaker's possible sentence, as well as increasing the minimum possible term two-fold, from four years to eight years.
The maximum possible sentence was increased from sixteen years to twenty-four or with aggravation to forty-eight.
"If a defendant faces punishment beyond that provided by statute when an offense is committed under certain circumstances but not others, it is obvious that both the loss of liberty and the stigma attaching to the offense are heightened; it necessarily follows that the defendant should not--at the moment the State is put to proof of those circumstances--be deprived of protections that have, until that point, unquestionably attached."
Apprendi, 530 U.S. at 484.
The presumption of a culpable mental state is such a protection.
"The safeguards of due process are not rendered unavailing simply because a determination may already have been reached that would stigmatize the defendant and that might lead to a significant impairment of personal liberty....[w]hen viewed in terms of the potential difference in restrictions of personal liberty attendant to each conviction, the distinction...[between the baseline and enhanced offense]
Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U.S. 684, 698 (1975); see also Jones v. United States, 526 U.S. (1999) (the Court could not presume that Congress, which is fully aware of the constitutional limits on its powers, intended that "the specification of facts sufficient to increase a penalty range by two-thirds, let alone from 15 years to life, was meant to carry none of the process safeguards that elements of an offense bring with them for the defendant's benefit"); People v. Quintana, 634 P.2d 413, 419 (Colo. 1981) (habitual criminal trial must be conducted in accordance with due process safeguards).
The mere fact that special offender has been called a sentence enhancing provision rather than an offense, in other words, does not mean that longstanding procedural protections, such as the presumption of a culpable mental state, fail to apply.
Exceptionally harsh punishment imposed for the additional act of importation into the state of Colorado requires a knowing mens rea on the part of the importer.
See Apprendi, supra.
A culpable mental state must be presumed absent a clear legislative intent that the provision is strict liability.
As demonstrated above, the legislative intent behind the enactment of the Controlled Substances Act is that courts will in fact apply this presumption and find a knowing mens rea wherever the Act is silent.
D.
The General Assembly has recognized the preference for a culpable mental state at Â§Â§ 18-1-102(1)(a) and 18-1-503, C.R.S.
The General Assembly specifies that crimes are strict liability when that is the intent.
Return to Table of Contents
The General Assembly has declared that one of the purposes of the criminal code is "to place limitations upon the condemnation of conduct as criminal when it is without fault."
Â§ 18-1-102(1)(a), C.R.S.
See Gross, 830 P.2d 933 (relying in part on 18-1-102(1)(a) in finding implied mens rea).
In addition, the General Assembly has codified the principle that crimes generally include a mens rea at C.R.S. 18-1-503:
(2) Although no culpable mental state is expressly designated in a statute defining an offense, a culpable mental state may nevertheless be required for the commission of that offense, or with respect to some or all of the material elements thereof, if the proscribed conduct necessarily involves such a culpable mental state.
The General Assembly knows how to create a strict liability offense.[15] The enactments referenced above show that the General Assembly does not intend by mere silence to create strict liability crimes.
Of course in this case, the Court has the benefit of comments in the legislative history showing that the General Assembly actually counted on the fact that courts would understand silence as requiring a knowing mens rea throughout the Controlled Substances Act.
The ad hoc addition of the word knowingly throughout the Act was voted down only after Representative Eberly noted that the appellate courts always read "knowingly" into the criminal statutes when there is no mens rea, and suggested it was not necessary to add the language to each and every provision, and Representative Skaggs concurred, and said the amendment was both unnecessary and confusing because it introduced things that "a court is going to insist upon as an element anyway."
(Audio Tape M1T-81, 18A, March 10, 1981 at 11:29, 11:36).
E.
There is no ambiguity about the fact that a knowing mens rea applies.
Even if there were ambiguity, it would be resolved in Mr. Whitaker's favor by the rule of lenity; the preference for construing a statute to obviate or reduce constitutional infirmities; and the presumption that the statute was intended to produce just and reasonable results.
Return to Table of Contents
As explained in parts II B - D, supra, there is no "clear legislative intent" that importation of methamphetamine into the state of Colorado is a strict liability offense.
Therefore, the statute it not ambiguous with respect to mens rea.
See Staples v. United States, 511 U.S. 600, 616 (1994):
In reaching our conclusion, we find it unnecessary to rely on the rule of lenity, under which an ambiguous criminal statute is to be construed in favor of the accused....Here, the background rule of the common law favoring mens rea and the substantial body of precedent we have developed construing statutes that do not specify a mental element provide considerable interpretive tools from which we can "seize aid," and they do not leave us with the ultimate impression that Â§ 5861(d) is "grievous[ly]" ambiguous.
Certainly, we have not concluded in the past that statutes silent with respect to mens rea are ambiguous.
Should this Court find any ambiguity, however, it must be resolved in favor of a culpable mental state.
The rule of lenity requires the Court to construe any ambiguities in a penal statute in a manner favoring the person whose liberty interests are affected by the statute.
In Re Fields v. Suthers, 984 P.2d 1167 (Colo. 1999); Liparota, 471 U.S. at 427 (relying in part on rule of lenity to find knowing mens rea in silent statute).
The rule of lenity or strict construction of criminal statutes is supported by the policy in favor of giving the public fair warning about "what conduct is punishable and how severe the punishment is."
See W. LaFave and A. Scott, Substantive Criminal Law Â§ 2.2 (d).
In addition, this Court should presume that our General Assembly intended to enact a fair and rational statute, and did not intend absurd results.
See Â§ 2-4-201(1)(c), C.R.S. (1999) ("In enacting a statute, it is presumed that...a just and reasonable result is intended"); see Â§ 2-4-203 (1), C.R.S. (1999) ("If a statute is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention of the general assembly, may consider among other matters...the consequences of a particular construction") see also X-Citement Video, Inc., 513 U.S. at 69; Liparota, 471 U.S. at 427.
Similarly, "it is well-settled in this state that whenever possible a statute should be construed as to obviate or reduce any constitutional infirmities."
People v. Washburn, 197 Colo. 419, 423, 593 P.2d 962 (1979).
Crimes with strict liability elements may violate Due Process.
See, e.g. People v. Johnson, 193 Colo. 199, 200, 564 P.2d 116 (Colo. 1977) (statute imposing liability for theft by receiving when the defendant merely "ha[s] reasonable cause to believe" the item is stolen is unconstitutionally overbroad); People v. Batchelor, 800 P.2d 599 (Colo. 1990) (ruling that "an element of scienter is required for section 18-6-403(3)(b) to be constitutional"); People v.

To avoid due process questions, this Court often construes statutes silent as to culpable mental state as containing a mens rea requirement.

Smith, 620 P.2d 232 (Colo. 1980) (avoiding constitutional question by finding mens rea); Sequin, supra (presuming that legislature intended to enact a constitutional statute, and therefore finding culpable mental state knowingly applied to all conduct elements); Batchelor, 800 P.2d 599; People v. Hart, 658 P.2d 857 (Colo. 1983) (concluding that knowing mental state is implied in second degree assault on police officer statute, and that the statute is therefore constitutional); Ault v. Department of Revenue, 697 P.2d 24 (Colo. 1985) ("Requiring knowledge of the "denial, cancellation, suspension, or revocation" underlying a charge of driving after judgment prohibited supplies a culpable mental state element for the charge, avoiding potential due process problems arising from a strict liability crime"); People v.

CONCLUSION Return to Table of Contents
For the reasons and authorities in Part I, Mr. Whitaker's conviction and sentence for possession of over one thousand grams of methamphetamine with intent to distribute must be vacated.
If this Court determines that the conviction for possession stands minus the element related to quantity, then the quantity-based enhanced sentence must be vacated, and the case remanded for resentencing.
For the reasons and authorities in Part II, Mr. Whitaker's special offender conviction must be vacated, and the case remanded for resentencing.

[1] Section 18-18-407(1)(d), 6 C.R.S. (1998), a class two felony.
[2] Section 18-18-405(3)(a)(III), 6 C.R.S. (1998), a class three felony.
[3] Section 18-18-405(2)(a)(I), 6 C.R.S. (1998), a class three felony.
[4] Section 18-18-428(1), 6 C.R.S. (1998), a class two petty offense.
[5] The current statute distinguishes between three different weight ranges - possession of between 28 and 450 grams, possession of between 450 and 1000 grams, and possession of over 1000 grams of a schedule I or II controlled substance.
[6] Relying on Ramirez, supra, the Court of Appeals affirmed the district court's ruling, holding that "the quantity of a controlled substance possessed is a sentence-enhancing circumstance, not a substantive element of the offense."
(See Opinion, p12) And, "[a] sentence-enhancing circumstance, because it is not a substantive element of an offense, does not require any culpable mental state.
. .
Therefore, the prosecution was not required to prove that defendant knew he possessed more than one kilogram."
(Opinion, p13)
[7] The Court undertook a "search for comparable examples" of the use of "serious bodily injury" within different statutory schemes and found that it was employed as an element in many other criminal statutes.
See Jones, 526 U.S. at 235.
Despite the fact that Congress had also explicitly treated "serious bodily injury" as a sentencing factor under certain circumstances, the Court concluded that the additional fact of "serious bodily injury" and its two counterparts in the separate subsections of the statute represented "separate and aggravated offenses" instead of mere sentencing circumstances.
Id.
The Court also noted that carjacking was a type of robbery, and "serious bodily injury has traditionally been treated, both by Congress and by the state legislatures, as defining an element of the offense of aggravated robbery."
Id.
[8] In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358, 364 (1970), discussed the due process burden to prove every element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.
The Mullaney decision also declined to adopt the State's characterization of "malice" as a mere sentencing factor because the State's reading "left its statute at odds with the centuries-old common law recognition of malice as the fact distinguishing murder from manslaughter and with the widely held modern view that heat of passion, once raised by the evidence, was a subject of the State's burden."
Jones, 526 U.S. at 240-41; see Mullaney, 421 U.S. at 692-96.
[9] At issue was a statutory provision that a judge's finding (by a preponderance) of visible possession of a firearm would require a mandatory minimum sentence for certain felonies, but a minimum that fell within the sentencing ranges otherwise prescribed.
See McMillan, 477 U.S. at 88.
[10] Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U.S. 224 (1998), stands for the proposition that recidivism increasing the maximum penalty need not be stated in a felony indictment, but this was distinct from the question in Jones.
See Jones, 526 U.S. at 248.
[11] See, e.g., United States v. Angle, 230 F.3d 113, 123 (4^th Cir. 2000) (applying Apprendi to a prosecution under 21 U.S.C. Â§ 841 and holding that drug quantity must be presented to a jury and proven beyond a reasonable doubt to impose a sentence greater than the twenty-year maximum authorized by 21 U.S.C. Â§ 841(b)(1)(C)); United States v. Doggett, 230 F.3d 160, 164-65 (5^th Cir. 2000) (same); United States v. Page, 232 F.3d 536, 542-3 (6^th Cir. 2000) (same); United States v. Aguayo-Delgado, 220 F.3d 926, 933-34 (8^th Cir. 2000) (same); United States v. Nordby, 225 F.3d 1053, 1059 (9^th Cir. 2000) (same); United States v. Rogers, 228 F.3d 1318, 1327 (11^th Cir. 2000) (same).
[12] The wording of Â§18-18-107(1)(d), now 407(1)(d), has remained substantially unchanged since its enactment to the time of the offense in this case.
[13] During this discussion one of the representatives made a joke to the effect of "wouldn't that be a usurpation of legislative power?" The joke drew several laughs.
The representatives' awareness that the courts would presume a mens rea shows that if they intended any provisions of the Act to be strict liability, they would have said so.
[14] The law enforcement witnesses described the provision as targeting "big time drug dealers," "somebody who's making a career off the sale of large amounts of drugs," "major dealers," "major peddlers--people who are involved in drug trafficking for a large monetary gain," and "major distributors."
Hearing on H.B. 1405 Before the House Judiciary Committee, 53rd Gen. Assembly, 1st Reg. Sess.
(Audio Tape M1T-81, 17A, March 5, 1981 at 3:08-3:10, 3:57, 4:08 p.m.).
[15] See, e.g., Â§ 18-3-106(1)(b)(I), C.R.S.(1998) ("If...such conduct is the proximate cause of the death of another, such person commits vehicular homicide.
This is a strict liability crime."); Â§Â§ 18-3-205(1)(b)(I); 42-4-1301(3), C.R.S. (1998) (vehicular assault and driving under the influence / while impaired statutes--similar language); Â§ 18-13-122(2) (a), C.R.S. (1998) ("Illegal possession or consumption of ethyl alcohol by an underage person is a strict liability offense"); Â§ 38-29-143(2), C.R.S.
("Any person who fails to file notice of any change of location...is guilty of a misdemeanor traffic offense....[t]his shall be a strict liability offense.").
