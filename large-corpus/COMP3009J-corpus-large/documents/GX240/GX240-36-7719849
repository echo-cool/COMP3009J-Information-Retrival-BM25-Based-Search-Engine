6.10.2.9 HOW TO DISPLAY THE FLAG
The National flag shall be raised and lowered by hand.
Do not raise the flag while it is furled.
Unfurl, then hoist quickly to the top of the staff.
Lower it slowly and with dignity.
Place no objects on or over the flag.
A speaker's table is sometimes covered with the flag.
This practice should be avoided.
When displayed with another flag from crossed staffs, the flag of the United States of America should be on the right (the flag's own right) and its staff should be in front of the staff of the other flag.
When it is flown at half-mast, the flag should be hoisted to the peak for an instant and then lowered to the half-mast position; but before lowering the flag for the day, it should again be raised to the peak.
By half-mast is meant hauling down the flag to one-half the distance between the top and the bottom of the staff.
On Memorial Day, display at half-mast until noon only; then hoist to the top of the staff.
When flags of states or cities or pennants of societies are flown on the same halyard with the flag of the United States, the latter should always be at the peak.
When flown from adjacent staffs, the Stars and Stripes should be hoisted first and lowered last.
When the flag is suspended over a sidewalk from a rope extending from house to pole at the edge of the sidewalk, the flag should be hoisted out from the building, toward the pole, union first.
When the flag is displayed from a staff projecting horizontally or at an angle from the windowsill, balcony, or front of a building, the union of the flag should go to the peak of the staff (unless the flag is to be displayed at half-mast).
When the flag is used to cover a casket, it should be so placed that the union is at the head and over the left shoulder.
When the flag is displayed in a manner other than being flown from a staff, it should be displayed flat, whether indoors or out.
When displayed either horizontally or vertically against a wall, the union should be uppermost and to the flag's own right, that is, to the observer's left.
When displayed in a window, it should be displayed in the same way, that is, with the union or blue field to the left of the observer in the street.
When festoons, rosettes or draping are desired, bunting of blue, white and red should be used, but never the flag.
When carried in a procession with another flag or flags, the United States of America flag should be either on the marching right, or when there is a line of other flags, in front of the center of that line.
When a number of flags of states or cities or pennants of societies are grouped and displayed from staffs with our National flag, the latter should be at the center or at the highest point of the group.
K.
When flags of two or more nations are displayed, they should be flown from separate staffs of the same height, and the flags should be of approximately equal size.
International usage forbids the display of the flag of one nation above that of another nation in peacetime.
The National flag shall be raised and lowered by hand.
Do not raise the flag while it is furled.
Unfurl, then hoist quickly to the top of the staff.
Lower it slowly and with dignity.
Place no objects on or over the flag.
A speaker's table is sometimes covered with the flag.
This practice should be avoided.
The flag shall be displayed with the union up.
The flag shall not be used as a portion of a costume or athletic uniform.
Do not embroider it upon cushions or handkerchiefs nor print it on paper napkins or boxes.
When the flag is used in unveiling a statue or monument, it should not serve as a covering of the object to be unveiled.
If it is displayed on such occasions, do not allow the flag to fall to the ground, but let it be carried aloft to form a feature of the ceremony.
Every precaution shall be taken to prevent the flag from being soiled.
It shall not be allowed to touch the ground or floor, or brush against objects.
