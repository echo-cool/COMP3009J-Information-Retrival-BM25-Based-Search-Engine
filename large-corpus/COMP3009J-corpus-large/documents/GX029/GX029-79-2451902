Indiana Man Sentenced to over 42 Years For Setting 26 Churches Ablaze
Timothy M. Morrison, United States Attorney for the Southern District of Indiana, announced that JAY SCOTT BALLINGER BALLINGER, 38, of Yorktown, Indiana, was sentenced to 42 years, 7 months imprisonment today by U.S. District Judge Sarah E. Barker following his guilty pleas on July 11, 2000, to one count of conspiracy to commit arson and church arson, six counts of arson of a building in interstate commerce, twenty counts of church arson, and two counts of using fire to commit a federal felony.
This case was the result of a nationwide investigation conducted by the National Church Arson Task Force, including investigators from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, investigators from the Indiana State Fire Marshal's Office, and numerous state and local fire investigators around the United States.
BALLINGER's sentence was a result of his guilty plea to the following charges: * Southern District of Indiana + 1 count conspiracy to commit arson / church arson + 3 counts arson of a building in interstate commerce + 8 counts church arson + 2 counts use of fire to commit a federal felony * Eastern District of Tennessee + 1 count church arson * Central District of California + 1 count arson of a building in interstate commerce * Western District of Kentucky + 4 counts church arson * Eastern District of Missouri + 1 count church arson * District of South Carolina + 1 count church arson * Northern District of Indiana + 1 count arson of a building in interstate commerce + 2 counts church arson * Southern District of Ohio + 1 count arson of a building in interstate commerce + 1 count church arson * Northern District of Alabama + 1 count church arson * Northern District of Ohio + 1 count church arson
Except for the case in the Southern District of Indiana, all of the other cases were previously filed by United States Attorneys Offices in the districts listed above.
The cases were coordinated by the National Church Arson Task Force in Washington D.C. and then transferred to the Southern District of Indiana where BALLINGER plead guilty to all of them.
"The rampage that resulted from the destructive acts of this one individual has ended," said Bill Lann Lee, Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, and Co-Chair of the NCATF.
"I hope that this sentence will help bring closure to those whose lives were harmed by these hateful acts, and sends a strong message that these crimes will not be tolerated.
The federal government remains steadfast in our cooperative efforts to continue to prosecute each and every one of these incidents to the fullest extent of the law."
According to Assistant United States Attorney Susan Heckard Dowd, who prosecuted the case for the government, Judge Barker also imposed three years supervised release following BALLINGER's release from imprisonment.
BALLINGER was also ordered to make restitution in the amount of $3,554,388.56 to the victim churches.
Other documents previously filed in the District Court set forth facts of the arson fires set by BALLINGER.
BALLINGER grew up in the Yorktown, Indiana area.
Throughout his adult life, BALLINGER traveled extensively throughout the United States, studying and practicing his religous beliefs as a Luciferian.
BALLINGER frequently expressed his hostility toward organized Christianity, signed individuals he met to contracts with the devil, and termed himself a Missionary of Lucifer and a Saint of Hades.
In late 1993, BALLINGER met an 18-year-old woman named Angela Wood with whom he soon entered into a romantic relationship.
BALLINGER and Wood traveled the country together, primarily living in motels on a short term basis.
Wood obtained short-term employment as a nightclub dancer at various locations around the United States, in order to support them and pay their living expenses.
Wood also assisted BALLINGER in setting many of the church fires, primarily acting as a lookout so no one would see BALLINGER set the fires, but also carrying gas cans and other supplies for BALLINGER while he set the fires.
BALLINGER's setting of church fires followed a distinct pattern.
Most of the fires were set late at night or early in the morning.
Most of the fires were set at isolated rural churches.
On most occasions, BALLINGER broke a window at the side or back of the church, poured a flammable mixture (usually gasoline) into the church, set the flammable mixture on fire with a lighter, then left the area.
The first church arson committed by BALLINGER and Wood was at the Concord Church of Christ, Lebanon, Indiana, on January 10, 1994.
This church was an approximately 100-year-old white frame church which was depicted in the opening scene of the movie "Hoosiers."
