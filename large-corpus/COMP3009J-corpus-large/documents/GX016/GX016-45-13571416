[bbluel.gif] FIC PROGRAMS AND INITIATIVES
Extramural Programs - Overview
The period since the last Advisory Board meeting has seen continued and expanded activities under the FIC Extramural Program.
Their has been a strong response to recent FIC Requests for Applications (RFA), including the Tobacco Use and Control Research Training Program, the Global Health Research Initiative for Foreign Investigators (GRIP), Phase I of the International Clinical, Operational and Health Services Research and Training Award for AIDS and Tuberculosis (ICOHRTA-AIDS/TB), and the International Bioethics Education and Career Development Award.
In addition, FIC reissued the Program Announcement for the Fogarty International Research Collaboration Award (FIRCA) in a modular format in February and plans to do the same for the AIDS FIRCA in shortly.
A new RFA for the International Centers of Excellence in Research (ICER) Program, a collaborative effort between FIC and NIAID, was published in the NIH Guide to Grants and Contracts on May 3 and, finally, FIC expects to issue an RFA for a new Stigma research program and Phase II of the ICOHRTA-AIDS/TB in the near future.
Third Global Forum on Bioethics in Research
The Third Global Forum on Bioethics in Research, organized by the United Kingdom Medical Research Council, was held in Cape Town, South Africa February 21-23.
The forum, launched by FIC in FY 2000, makes it possible for representatives from the developing world to share ideas and provide input on important ethical issues related to international collaborative research sponsored by industrialized countries and undertaken in the developing world.
The Forum was supported by FIC, the Medical Research Councils of South Africa and the United Kingdom, the World Health Organization, and the Wellcome Trust.
Of the 110 delegates attending the meeting, two- thirds came from developing countries.
Half of the 40 countries represented at the meeting were African.
The Forum considered three main themes and issues: 1) whether current ethical guidelines constrain or promote access to drugs, devices or vaccines subsequent to a trial; 2) challenges in developing ethical guidelines and review processes in developing countries; and 3) the standard of care to be provided during trials.
Case studies were used to illustrate these issues and to focus discussion.
Case studies also prompted discussion on the use of traditional medicines in research, genomics and global health, and culture and informed consent.
Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries Project (DCPP)
The Global Health Program of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has awarded $3,505,000.00 to NIH to reassess and update the 1993 World Bank publication Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries.
The update of this publication is part of the three-year Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries Project (DCPP), a partnership between the World Bank, WHO, and the NIH that aims to produce authoritative, science-based publications and other resource materials to informnational-level and global-level health policy directed to improving conditions in resource-poor countries.
The second edition of this publication will be based on extensive analytical work and consultations with scientific and technical experts and policy makers around the world.
FIC is the site of the DCPP Secretariat.
Consultation on Modeling of Smallpox
FIC hosted a consultation in May on modeling the impact and control of smallpox.
The consultation was focused on infectious disease models that were tuned to address smallpox.
This consultation was a follow-up to an earlier consultation last December to determine the potential utility of mathematical and computational modeling in preparing for and responding to emerging infectious diseases and bioterrorism events.
Multilateral Initiative on Malaria (MIM)
MIM convened the first international conference on Plasmodium vivax malaria research in February in Bangkok, Thailand.
The conference attracted more than 180 of the worlds leading Vivax malaria scientists representing 25 countries and was supported by the MIM and its partners, including the NIH, Roll Back Malaria at the WHO, The Wellcome Trust, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Institut Pasteur, USAID, Mahidol University (Bangkok, Thailand), the Ministry of Health of Thailand, the Asian Centre of International Parasite Control (ACIPAC), and the Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR).
Research gaps and opportunities were identified.
MIM staff is planning and organizing the Third MIM Pan-African Conference, which will be held in Arusha, Tanzania November 18-22.
More than 600 abstracts were received prior to the May 1 deadline.
The Conference Theme Coordinators will review these abstracts in late May, make selections for sponsorship and finalize the Conference program.
MIM has also released a call for applications for the next MIM Secretariat.
FIC has served as the Secretariat for the last two years.
When the MIM was initiated in 1997, it was agreed that the Secretariat would rotate among MIM partners at regular intervals in order to maintain the multilateral nature of MIM and to represent all MIM partners.
FICs tenure will come to an end after the MIM Pan-African Conference in Arusha, Tanzania in November 2002 and the decision regarding the Secretariats transfer to the next organization will be made by early summer.
Medicine and the Media
FIC is in the process of consulting with a number of international and domestic public health, journalism, and communications stakeholders, a process that may in the future lead to an RFA related to media coverage of international public health issues -- to promote accuracy of reporting and to explain the medicine and science behind the research performed in the developing world.
A meeting on medical journalism, organized by FICs AIDS International Training and Research Program (AITRP) grantees at Berkeley and held May 2-3 in Bethesda, focused on what subject matter should be fundamental to coverage of health issues, while at the same time allowing such a curriculum to be adjusted to take into account specific health priorities of particular countries.
The meeting discussed how best this might be done through workshops or fellowships and using the internet, using physicians and scientists in FIC training programs, developing mentoring systems between North and South, and pooling of information resources.
An FIC-sponsored consultation took place on May 6 at NIH to explore the idea of collaborations between schools of journalism and schools of public health (ideally on the same campus or the same city, especially in developing nations) for joint registration of courses, joint degrees, fellowships, exchanges of faculty, etc.
Other options to be considered include: * Training workshops and short- and long-term fellowships for developing country journalists in which physicians, health professionals and scientists would be involved in explaining the science behind major diseases and particular health conditions; * Building capacity at developing country medical journals, through training courses, exchanges, fellowships, and peer-review collaborations; and * Support for media training of health professionals to learn how to communicate clearly with the media and understand how the media works, through courses and workshops.
Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria (GFATM): Technical Review
On January 14, FIC hosted a Working Group on Technical Review for the GFATM.
The Working Group developed and forwarded to the Funds Governing Board for approval a set of recommendations on the operation of a Technical Review Panel (TRP) that will review applications submitted to the GFATM for funding and provide recommendations to the Governing Board.
In late February FIC, in cooperation with OAR, NIAID, NICHD, and NHLBI, recommended a list of nominees to serve on the TRP and forwarded them, through HHS, to the GFATM Secretariat for further consideration.
The first round of TRP reviews took place March 25-April 4 in Geneva.
The GFATM has received pledges of nearly $1.9 billion, including $500 million from the U.S. and recently announced its intention to fund 40 projects in 31 countries for a total commitment of about $600 million, contingent on satisfactory progress.
Humanitarian Demining
FIC hosted a seminar on humanitarian demining on March 8 to learn about the scope of injuries due to landmines and of U.S. Government and non-governmental organization efforts to address this problem.
The discussion is part of an exploration at FIC to consider trauma, burns, and injuries in the developing world.
Participants included representatives of the Office of Mine Action Initiative and Partnerships, the Department of State, the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research, the Department of Education, the War Victims Fund, and the National Center for Medical Rehabilitation Research of NICHD.
