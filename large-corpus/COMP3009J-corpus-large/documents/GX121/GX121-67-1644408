ABSTRACT: We examined the effects of atrazine (0-20 mg/L) on embryos, larvae, and adult anuran amphibian species in the laboratory.
Atrazine treatments did not affect hatchability of embryos or 96-h posthatch mortality of larvae of Rana pipiens, Rana sylvatica, or Bufo americanus.
Furthermore, atrazine had no effect on swimming speed (measured for R. pipiens only).
However, there was a dose-dependent increase in deformed larvae of all three species with increasing atrazine concentration.
In adult R. pipiens, atrazine increased buccal and thoracic ventilation, indicating respiratory distress.
However, because atrazine had no affect on hemoglobin, this respiratory distress was probably not indicative of reduced oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood.
Frogs exposed to the highest atrazine concentration stopped eating immediately after treatment began and did not eat during the 14-d experiment.
However, no decreases in mass were measured even for frogs that were not eating, probably because of compensatory fluid gain from edema.
Atrazine concentrations found to be deleterious to amphibian embryos and adults are considerably higher than concentrations currently found in surface waters in North America.
Therefore, direct toxicity of atrazine is probably not a significant factor in recent amphibian declines.

ABSTRACT: Biologist believe that amphibians, which have thin skin and live in aquatic environments, are particularly sensitive to environmental toxins and changes in the environment.
Since natural populations of amphibians in North America have high incidence of limb abnormalities, researchers look for causes of these deformities.
Some claim biochemical perturbation, and others contend that mechanical perturbation causes deformed amphibians.
Certain studies have shown that the only known chemicals that cause deformities are retinoids (analogues of vitamin A), particularly retinoic acid (RA).
Because retinoids play an important role in normal biological development and are also teratogens, which can cause damage to the human fetus, the possibility of their involvement in environmental biochemical perturbation is of great interest.
Recent investigations found that cysts can cause mechanical perturbation in amphibian limb buds.
Parasitic worms (digenetic trematodes) induce cysts in the hind limbs of amphibian larvae.
These parasite cysts cause mechanical perturbation in early limb buds, which initiates positional confrontation among cells.
This results in intercalation that gives rise to bony triangles and extra (supernumerary) limb structures.
Researchers compared the range of limb deformities caused by parasites to the range of limb deformities caused by mechanical perturbation through microsurgical limb bud rotation.
They collected eggs of the wood frog (Rana sylvatica) and raised the tadpoles until their limb buds displayed posterior specks of pigment (stages 51-52).
They surgically removed, rotated, and grafted the limb buds back onto the anesthetized tadpoles and raised those with successful grafts through metamorphosis.
Analysis of skeletal development at the perimetamorphic stage revealed that limb bud rotation caused limb deformities in 80% of the specimens.
These deformities included 10% double anterior mirror image duplication (AMID), 14% double posterior mirror image duplication (PMID), 8% mirror image triplication (MIT), 10% twisted supernumerary limbs in dorsal-ventral mirror image duplication (DVMID), 26% bony triangles with adjacent proximal and distal bone ends, and 60% nonspecific deformities.
The researchers concluded that, because morphological results of limb bud rotation and trematode cyst infestation are indistinguishable, these results support the hypothesis that mechanical perturbations of parasites cause limb deformities in wild amphibian populations.

ABSTRACT: It has been known for several years that the fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) have potent mesoderm-inducing activity.
As a resul t they have been considered good candidates for one of the endogenous vegetally localized mesoderm-inducing signals in the amphibian Xenopus laevis.
In this review the properties of the FGFs and their expression patterns in Xenopus are described.
Recent work is discussed which reveals a close link between FGF signalling and regulation of the Xenopus brachyury (Xbra) gene.
These data are used to build a model of FGF function which is quite different from what was originally conceived.
Present evidence supports the view that during blastula stages the FGFs d o not act as vegetally localized inducing signals.
Instead, they ar e required in the animal hemisphere as competence factors, which provide a low level stimulation of the tyrosine kinase signal transduction pathway.
FGF activity is necessary for the full rang e of responses to the vegetal inducing signals, including the activation of Xbra transcription in the marginal zone of the late blastula.
Xbra is able to activate the zygotic transcription of eFGF, which suggests that there is a period of autocatalytic activation of eFGF and Xbra transcription within the forming mesoderm of the marginal zone.
FGF activity continues to be required to maintain the expression of a sub-set of mesodermal genes, including Xbra, in the blastopore region and possibly also in the notochord through gastrula and neurula stages.
In addition a role for the FGFs in anteroposterior specification and development of the myogenic lineages is discussed.

ABSTRACT: Numerous reports of malformed amphibians from across North America have prompted investigations into the cause(s) of the abnormalities and their implications for affected populations.
While many agents may be responsible for the national phenomenon, reports of amphibian limb malformations in the western U.S. correlate strongly to infection by a parasitic trematode (Ribeiroia ondatrae).
In laboratory experiments Ribeiroia causes high frequencies of limb malformations and reduced survivorship in metamorphosing anurans.
Although similar malformations have been recorded in the West over the last century, reports from the last decade detail a greater frequency range of more severe malformations from a larger number of sites and species.
The intensity of trematode infections in other parts of the world have been dramatically influenced by human activity, particularly via the transport of non-indigenous host species and the modification of wetland habitats.
These changes have sometimes caused outbreaks of trematode-related diseases in intermediate host populations.
While not an exotic genus in the western U.S., Ribeiroia may have recently increased in range or density in response to substantial alterations of western aquatic systems.
Planorbid snails, the first intermediate hosts in the Ribeiroia life cycle, thrive in permanent, highly productive ponds, which have become an increasingly common habitat over the last 70 years.
Cultural eutrophication, a frequent consequence of human activity around wetlands, can facilitate elevated densities of these snails and their resident parasites.
Higher intensities of Ribeiroia infection translate directly to higher rates of more severe malformations in amphibian hosts.
Additionally, human-modified wetlands serve as important foraging grounds for waterfowl, including many known Ribeiroia hosts.
Increases in some of these species' populations have recently been recorded in the western U.S. Considering the debilitating nature of the observed limb malformations, their widespread occurrence in the West, and the number of amphibian species affected, we believe parasite-induced malformations may represent a concern deserving further investigation.
In the continued study of this issue, we advocate (1) an evaluation of the long-term, population level threat to amphibians presented by Ribeiroia infection and the resulting malformations, and (2) field and laboratory studies on the effects of human activity, particularly elevated nutrient levels, on the Ribeiroia host-parasite complex and its pathology in amphibians.

ABSTRACT: At the first World Congress of Herpetology in 1989, biologists compared accounts of unexplained disappearances of various frog species that were occurring throughout the world.
This resulted in the formation of a special task force to investigate the phenomenon, and extensive research has since been conducted on amphibian populations.
Although many species and several areas of the world remain unaffected, widespread extinctions and declines have been documented.
Recently numerous reports in the news media about seriously deformed frogs, dramatic loss of amphibian populations in the western U.S., and a new virulent disease affecting amphibians in Australia, lower Central America,
and Arizona have increased scientists' concerns.
A workshop sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF) drew scientists from around the world.
The aim was to determine whether the threat of amphibian extinctions is increasing and to recommend research and management actions in response to changing world amphibian populations.
Participants agreed on six fundamental points: (1) The phenomenon is real and documented species loss and/or declines have occurred in North and South America and Australia.
(2) Not all species in a given region are affected equally.
(3) There are so many potential causative agents that investigations have shifted from these to factors that lead to widespread generalized stress among amphibians.
(4) Basic issues of population biology are vital to understanding species loss and decline.
(5) Problems of access to data hinder communication among researchers.
(6) Coordination of activity is needed.
Specific proposals that were agreed on included development of the Cordillera Initiative, a new distributed institute linking research units in the Americas.
Specialized workshops on amphibian diseases and immunity, population and community ecology and monitoring, ecotoxicology, and developmental biology will be organized.
Bioinformatics systems will be developed.

ABSTRACT: Malformations represent an error that occurred early in developme nt.
However, the event that caused the malformation is temporally distant from the malformation we see in the fully developed anima l.
The occurrence and the type of malformations are influenced by the type of error as well as the timing of the error.
The appearance of the malformation can therefore provide clues that suggest when the error may have occurred.
It is hoped that this categorization of malformations will facilitate the investigation of the causes of abnormal development in wild frog populations.

ABSTRACT: In previously conducted laboratory studies with the South African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis), pond water and sediment samples collected from various sites in Minnesota, USA, were demonstrated to have the potential to induce a variety of developmental abnormalities, including early embryo-larval maldevelopment, abnormal limb development, and disruption of metamorphosis.
The results of exposure to X. laevis to suspect pond water and sediment samples supported the hypothesis that these samples were capable of inducing these abnormalities as the result of either the presence of developmental toxicants or the absence of essential micronutrients.
Physicochemical characterization of the causes of abnormal frog embryo-larval and limb development were performed using the frog embryo teratogenesis assay -- Xenopus (FETAX).
Specific compounds were subsequently identified within the complex mixture fractions and tested by dilution in a control solution and native reference water using both the 4- and 30-d treatment protocols.
Results from these studies suggested that a complex mixture of both naturally occurring and man-made compounds was primarily responsible for the effects observed in X. laevis.
The potency of several compounds was also enhanced by the site water, thus indicating that the water matrix deserves consideration as a contributing factor for both laboratory and field studies.

ABSTRACT: In recent years, there has been an increase in the incidence of frog deformities throughout many of the northern states of North America.
The most readily noticed malformations involve the hindlimbs of peri-metamorphic animals.
We have analyzed skeletal preparations of metamorphosing mink frogs (Rana septentrionalis) collected from a site in Minnesota, in order to develop a better understanding of the possible causes.
In this paper we describe the categories of abnormalities found at this site.
The spectrum of deformities includes missing limbs, truncated limbs, extra limbs (including extra pelvic girdles), and skin webbings.
We also describe a newly recognized malformation of the proximal- distal limb axis, a bony triangle.
In this abnormality, the proximal and distal ends of the bone are adjacent to one another forming the base of a triangle.
The shaft of the bone is bent double and protrudes laterally, the midpoint of the bone forming the apex of the triangle.
In this paper we consider several recently proposed explanations for the recent outbreak of amphibian deformities.
Based on our analysis, we conclude that the spectrum of abnormalities seen in these frogs is remarkably similar to the range of abnormalities that has been reported as a result of exposure of developing vertebrates to exogenous retinoids.
Given the potential implications of this possibility for the welfare of humans as well as wildlife, further studies are needed to determine whether environmental retinoids are responsible for the frog deformities at the site we have examined.

ABSTRACT: Widespread reports of malformed amphibians in North America have prompted investigations into the cause(s) and implications of the phenomenon.
Recently, a trematode parasite (Ribeiroia ondatrae) was identified as the probable cause of hind-limb malformations in Pacific treefrogs (Hyla regilla) from California.
We exposed a second anuran species, the western toad (Bufo boreas), to specific levels of R. ondatrae infection.
In a dose-dependent manner, R. ondatrae infection induced high frequencies (40-85%) of severe limb malformations in surviving toads.
Survivorship declined significantly with increasing parasite exposure, falling to 42% in the heaviest treatment.
Larvae in control treatments exhibited normal development and low mortality levels.
In contrast to previous experiments with R. ondatrae infection in treefrogs, cutaneous fusion was the predominant malformation among infected toads in all treatments.
Infection also caused polymely (extra limbs; fore and hind), ectromely (missing limbs), polydactyly (extra digits), and a variety of additional limb malformations.
Taken together, these results demonstrate that (i) the teratogenic effects of R. ondatrae are not limited to treefrogs, (ii) the spectrum of R. ondatrae-induced malformations is not confined to the hind limbs,

ABSTRACT: While malformed frogs also have been found in many other states, numerous studies have focused on malformed frogs in Minnesota, and significant progress toward finding a cause or causes for malformations has been made.
This fact sheet summarizes scientific results from malformed frog studies conducted primarily in Minnesota, where at some sites the percentages of malformed frogs have been much higher since 1995.
Many frog malformations in the western United States appear to be caused by the parasite Ribeiroia ondatrae, a trematode that develops inside aquatic snails before burrowing into tadpoles.
At several of the abnormal frog sites in Minnesota the frogs are heavily infested with Ribeiroia, however, Ribeiroia has not been found at other abnormal frog sites in the state indicating that other factors are causing malformations at those sites.
It is not clear why Ribeiroia infection may have increased in recent
years, but there is evidence that higher levels of nutrients may promote the parasite's life cycle.

ABSTRACT: Currently, two leading hypotheses have emerged to explain the occurrence of deformed amphibians with extra limbs in the wild: biochemical perturbation induced by environmental retinoids, and mechanical perturbation induced by parasite cysts.
The idea that mechanical perturbation is sufficient to induce the observed deformities including extra limbs was tested.
This was done using microsurgery to mechanically perturb the developing limbs of the developing limbs of frog tadpoles.
The range of morphologies produced through microsurgical-induced mechanical perturbation is indistinguishable from the range of morphologies produced by cysts and those found in the wild.
The deformities include bony triangles, which were formerly thought to be diagnostic of retinoids.
We conclude that mechanical perturbation is sufficient to produce limb deformities, including outgrowth of supernumerary limbs and bony triangles.
This indicates that many of the deformities seen in the wild may be produced by mechanical perturbation induced by parasite cysts.

ABSTRACT: In the past decade, numerous sights across North America have been found which contain abnormal levels of deformed amphibians.
This deformation was not limited to species, geography, or climate and spanned a wide range of phenotypes.
This report begins to explain these findings by examining the effects of pesticide degradation in early amphibian development through directly exposing Xenopus laevis embryos to trace levels of synthetically prepared degradates.
This method specifically determines the risk posed by each individual chemical resulting from the natural fate of the host pesticide.
Through this approach, we find that while the common insect growth regulator, S-methoprene, poses minimal developmental determent, products of its reaction with sunlight, water, and microorganisms dramatically interfere with normal amphibian development.
The addition of 1 muL/L of several of S-methoprene's degradates to the environment of developing embryos resulted in juveniles with deformation similar to that found naturally.
Current developmental assessments examine only the risk posed by host pesticides.
This study now suggest that the simple examination of the these materials is not sufficient, but now forward the need for critically examining the temporal relation between both development and chemical degradation.

ABSTRACT: Analytically impure (approximately 85-88%) and purified (99.5%) preparations of two sulfonylurea herbicides, sulfometuron methyl and nicosulfuron, were evaluated for short- and long- term developmental effects on organogenesis (0-4 d) and limb development (0-30 d), and impact on metamorphosis (tail resorption [50-64 d]).
Overall, the analytically impure sulfonylurea herbicides were more developmentally toxic than the purified preparations.
Purified preparations did not induce early embryo-larval developmental effects or effects on hind limb development, although the rate of tail resorption was slowed at relatively high concentrations.
Tail resorption rates were slowed significantly and abnormal limb development was induced by the analytically impure sulfonylurea herbicides.
The process of organogenesis as monitored by the traditional frog embryo teratogenesis assay-Xenopus (FETAX) test was the least sensitive stage of development monitored in this study.
Although some maldevelopment was induced at the limit of aqueous solubility of the analytically impure material, the severity of the malformations with the impure preparations was moderate.
Based on this study, the analytically impure herbicides were more developmentally toxic than purified preparations of the same herbicides, which exerted little effect at maximum soluble concentrations.
Thus, the capacity of purified nicosulfuron and sulfometuron methyl to interfere with amphibian development and maturation seems to be relatively low.

ABSTRACT: Short-term static-renewal studies were performed on Xenopus embryos from day 5 (Stage 46) to day 26 (Stage 54) [21-d test] with copper and acetyl hydrazide to evaluate effects on limb development.
Studies with pentachlorophenol, nonylphenol, methimazole (anti-triiodothyronine [T sub(3)), and tamoxifen (anti-estradiol) were also performed from day 50 (Stage 60) to da y 64 (Stage 66) [14-d test] to evaluate effects on tail resorption.
Both copper and acetyl hydrazide caused abnormal development of the hind limbs at concentrations of greater than or equal to 0.5 mg/L and greater than or equal to 25.0 mg/L, respectively.
Malformation of the hind limbs were primarily characterized as reduction deficiencies, but acetyl hydrazide also caused flexure defects.
Pentachlorophenol and methimazole decreased the rate of tail resorption significantly in metamorphs, whereas nonylphenol increased the rate of tail resorption.
Tamoxifen had no effect on the rate of tail resorption.
These results suggested that alteration in the rate of tail resorption during metamorphosis in Xenopus is at least partially under the control of T sub(3) and/o r T sub(3)-like hormones.
The stimulatory effects observed with nonylphenol did not appear to be associated with estrogenic activity since tamoxifen did not alter the rate of tail resorption.

ABSTRACT: We examined the effects of atrazine (0-20 mg/L) on embryos, larvae, and adult anuran amphibian species in the laboratory.
Atrazine treatments did not affect hatchability of embryos or 96-h posthatch mortality of larvae of Rana pipiens, Rana sylvatica, or Bufo americanus.
Furthermore, atrazine had no effect on swimming speed (measured for R. pipiens only).
However, there was a dose-dependent increase in deformed larvae of all three species with increasing atrazine concentration.
In adult R. pipiens, atrazine increased buccal and thoracic ventilation, indicating respiratory distress.
However, because atrazine had no affect on hemoglobin, this respiratory distress was probably not indicative of reduced oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood.
Frogs exposed to the highest atrazine concentration stopped eating immediately after treatment began and did not eat during the 14-d experiment.
However, no decreases in mass were measured even for frogs that were not eating, probably because of compensatory fluid gain from edema.
Atrazine concentrations found to be deleterious to amphibian embryos and adults are considerably higher than concentrations currently found in surface waters in North America.
Therefore, direct toxicity of atrazine is probably not a significant factor in recent amphibian declines.

ABSTRACT: The effects of retinoids on the regenerating amphibian limb are described: the mesenchymal cells of the blastema can be proximalized, posteriorized and ventralized.
Ectopic limbs are also induced after retinoid treatment of regenerating tails, but not during limb development unless the limb bud is damaged.
The cellular and molecular alterations induced by retinoids are reported as well as experiments which have revealed the importanc e of endogenous retinoids for normal limb regeneration.
Various retinoic acid receptors are expressed in the regeneration blastem a and the experiments which have revealed functions for individual isoforms are described.
These experiments reveal that retinoids are a crucial component of the normal, regenerating limb and demonstrate the value of the regenerating limb as an experimental system for providing functional data on individual retinoic acid receptors.

ABSTRACT: A few years ago, rumors of malformed frogs in America's northern Great Plains started circulating.
Scientists began investigating the cause of these frog malformations.
They theorize that the malformations are a result of parasites, ultraviolet radiation, or an environmental chemical.
Amphibian researcher Stanley Sessions and a colleague noticed that the Pacific tree frogs' hind limbs were packed with encysted trematodes, parasitic flatworms that burrow into amphibians.
The researchers found that when they embedded plastic beads, meant to resemble cysts, in the limbs of developing frogs and salamanders, the limbs would sometimes split and form two.
Sessions thinks natural and sporadic peaks in populations of pond snails, the trematodes' primary host, may explain the apparent rise in deformed frogs.
Other researchers have fingered a different source, the increase in ultraviolet B (UVB) light reaching Earth's surface because of the thinning ozone layer.
UVB light, the theory goes, could be damaging amphibian embryo DNA, resulting in abnormalities during metamorphosis; it could also be transforming pesticides into teratogens, chemicals that can interfere with development and cause birth defects.
Scientists have reported that northern leopard frog embryos develop abnormalities, including deformed and missing limbs, after being exposed to about 30% of natural UVB levels for at least 24 days.
A third possibility is that certain watersheds may harbor an unidentified teratogen, presumably an environmental contaminant.
Some scientists suspect retinoids, a class of chemicals including vitamin A that tell embryo cells to grow.
Experiments have shown that retinoids can cause limb malformations in frogs.
One candidate might be an insecticide such as Methoprene, a retinoid mimic widely used to kill mosquitoes.

ABSTRACT: In this study we report mortality rates of adults of Rana pipiens to mild acid exposure and pH preferences for R. pipiens and R. clamitans.
We exposed adult R. pipiens to mildly acidic conditions for a ten day period under controlled laboratory conditions.
Frogs exposed to citrate buffer at pH 5.5 for 10d exhibited 72% mortality as compared with 3.5% mortality in the control group held at pH 7.0.
Furthermore, within the pH 5.5 group there was a difference in acid sensitivity based on season.
All of the frogs that had recently emerged from hibernation died within the first four days of exposure to pH 5.5, whereas frogs that were post breeding suffered 58% mortality throughout the 10 d of the experiment.
This study also examined the pH preferences of adult frogs.
Individuals of R. pipiens (N=24) and R. clamitans (N=12) were placed in a six-compartment experimental chamber filled with three different pH solutions buffered to pH 4.0, 5.5, and 7.0.
Frogs of both species preferred the more neutral pHs.
Our results suggest that adults of R. pipiens are sensitive to mildly acidic conditions, especially when emerging from hibernation, and that adults of both R. pipiens and R. clamitans can discriminate between acidic and neutral pH environments.

ABSTRACT: In recent studies, a high incidence of amphibian mortality and malformation has been reported in the field, suggesting that toxic and/or bioactive agents are present in the environment of the affected amphibians.
This study provides evidence for this hypothesis, because it applies to several affected ponds Minnesota and Vermont, USA.
Three developmental bioassays were carried out on samples from three reference and three test sites in Minnesota and one reference and three test sites in Vermont.
The bioassays utilized Xenopus as a model system, measuring altered developmental patterns during the first 4 d of development (frog embryo teratogenesis assay -- Xenopus [FETAX]), hind-limb development over a 30-d period, and tail length resorption over a 14-d period.
Strong correlations were observed among the results for all three in vitro bioassays, as well as between adverse developmental effects in vitro and in the field.

ABSTRACT: Effects of ultraviolet radiation on hatching success, larval survival, and induced abnormalities were tested in three threatened (Hyla arborea, Bufo calamita, and Triturus cristatus) and two common (Rana temporaria and Bufo bufo) amphibians of Sweden.
In the laboratory, all species were exposed to artificial UV-radiation (intensities corresponding to midsummer conditions in Sweden) or visible light (controls) for ten days, during which hatching occurred.
The effects of ambient levels of UV-radiation on hatching success and survival of B. bufo, R. temporaria, and B. calamita were also determined during outdoor conditions when exposed to three different light regimes: Full solar radiation, UV-filtered sunlight (exposed to photosynthetically active radiation only) or darkness.
In the laboratory experiment, neither eggs nor larvae of R. temporaria, B. bufo, B. calamita, and H. arborea were negatively affected by UV-radiation.
However, UV-radiation induced darker pigmentation in tadpoles of H. arborea.
Only one species, T. cristatus, showed reduced hatching frequencies and lower larval survival when exposed to UV-radiation in comparison to visible light.
However, since female T. cristatus wrap their eggs in macrophyte leaves, embryos are effectively protected against solar radiation.
In the outdoor experiments, there were no differences between the light treatments for any of the species.
Thus, none of these species are likely to be threatened by moderately increased levels of ultraviolet radiation.

High prevalences of hindlimb deformities were recorded in wild-caught green frogs (Rana clamitans), northern leopard frogs (Rana pipiens), American toads (Bufo americanus), and bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana) from agricultural sites exposed to pesticide runoff in the St. Lawrence river Valley of Quebec, Canada, between July and September 1992 and 1993.
Of 853 metamorphosing anurans examined in 14 farmland habitats, 106 (12%; range 0 to 69%) had severe degrees of ectromelia and ectrodactyly, compared to only two (0.7%; range 0 to 7.7%) of 271 in 12 control sites.
However, the variation in the proportion of deformities among sites was too large to conclude that there was a significant difference between control and pesticide-exposed habitats.
Clinical signs varied and were characterized by segmental hypoplasia or agenesis of affected limbs.
Conspicuous abnormalities interfered with swimming and hopping, and likely constituted a survival handicap.
Because of circumstances and the frequency of these malformations in nine distinct habitats, and in three different species from one of our study sites, we propose a teratogenic action of exogenous factors.
Despite the fact that many biotic and abiotic agents are potentially harmful to limb development, agricultural contaminants were suspected as primary aggressors.
Thus, clinical examination and frequency of deformities in anurans might be an economical screening tool to assess ecosystem health and the presence of environmental contaminants.

ABSTRACT: Studies suggest that increased ground-level UV-B radiation due to stratospheric ozone depletion is adversely affecting many aquatic organisms.
In particular, ambient UV-B radiation can kill or deform amphibian embryos and may be contributing to global amphibian declines.
Sensitivity tests have been conducted primarily at northern latitudes (
Studies in southern California and Spain, however, suggest that some amphibians are vulnerable to ambient UV-B at these lower latitudes.
We tested the sensitivity of pond-breeding amphibians to UV-B radiation in the southern Appalachian Mountains (35degreeN; 660 m) of the United States, where stratospheric ozone has declined during the last two decades.
We exposed eggs of frogs (Hyla chrysoscelis, Pseudacris triseriata, Rana sylvatica) and a salamander (Ambystoma maculatum) to three treatments under field conditions that provided maximum exposure to solar radiation: (1) a polycarbonate filter that blocks 
Survivorship to hatching (grand mean = 91%) and the percentage of embryos deformed (grand mean = 4.4%) did not differ significantly among treatments for any species, but differences in the percentage of embryos deformed approached statistical significance for Hyla (p = 0.06) and Pseudacris (p = 0.10).
More refined analyses using orthogonal contrasts revealed that deformity rates for both species were significantly lower in embryos that were shielded from UV-B than in unshielded controls.
A pooled analysis of all anurans also indicated that deformity rates were higher in treatments with UV-B transmitting plates than in those with blocking plates.
Collectively, our data suggest that pond-breeding amphibians in the southern Appalachians currently incur only slight risk from exposure to ambient UV-B radiation.
If ground- level radiation increases in the future, the risk for certain species could increase significantly.

ABSTRACT: Tadpoles of toad, Bufo andersonii were reared in the media containing .007, .008, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04 and 0.05 mg/ml solution of zinc sulphate for 15 days.
The treatment resulted in retarded body growth, depigmentation, curved tail, inhibition of limb development and reduction in size of the gonad with an early differentiation of cortex and medulla.
These effects were correlated with the amount of zinc present in the rearing medium.

ABSTRACT: Background: Reports of malformed frogs have increased throughout the North American continent in recent years.
Most of the observed malformations have involved the hind limbs.
The goal of this study was to accurately characterize the hind limb malformations in wild frogs as an important step toward understanding the possible etiologies.
Methods:
During 1997 and 1998, 182 recently meta-morphosed northern leopard frogs (Rana pipiens) were collected from Minnesota, Vermont, and Maine.
Malformed hind limbs were present in 157 (86%) of these frogs, which underwent necropsy and radiographic evaluation at the National Wildlife Health Center.
These malformations are described in detail and classified into four major categories: (1) no limb (amelia); (2) multiple limbs or limb elements (polymelia, polydactyly, polyphalangy); (3) reduced limb segments or elements (phocomelia, ectromelia, ectrodactyly, and brachydac-tyly; and (4) distally complete but malformed limb (bone rotations, bridging, skin webbing, and micromelia).
Results: Amelia and reduced segments and/or ele-ments were the most common finding.
Frogs with bi-lateral hind limb malformations were not common, and in only eight of these 22 frogs were the malformations symmetrical.
Malformations of a given type tended to occur in frogs collected from the same site, but the types of malformations varied widely among all three states, and between study sites within Minnesota.
Conclusions: Clustering of malformation type sug-gests that developmental events may produce a variety of phenotypes depending on the timing, sequence, and severity of the environmental insult.
Hind limb malfor-mations in free-living frogs transcend current mecha-nistic explanations of tetrapod limb development.

ABSTRACT: Recent experiments suggest that timing of metamorphosis is fixed during development in some anurans, insects, and freshwater invertebrates.
Yet, these experiments do not exclude a growth rat e optimization model for the timing of metamorphosis.
I manipulated food resources available to larvae of squirrel treefrogs (Hyla squirella) to determine if there is a loss of plasticity in duration of larval period during development and to critically test growth rate models for the timing of metamorphosis.
Size-specific resource levels for individual tadpoles were switched from low to high or high to low at three developmental stages spaced throughout larval development.
The effects of changes in resource availability on larval period and mass at metamorphosis were measured.
Switching food levels after late lim b bud development did not significantly affect larval period in comparison to constant food level treatments.
Therefore, developmental rate in H. squirella is better described by a fixed developmental rate model, rather than a growth rate optimization model.
The timing of fixation of developmental rate in H. squirella is similar to that found in other anuran species, suggesting a taxonomically widespread developmental constraint on the plasticity of larval period duration.
Mass at metamorphosis was not significantly affected by the timing of changes in food levels; the amount of food available later in development determined the size at metamorphosis.
Larval period and mass at metamorphosis were negatively correlated in only one of two experiments, which contrasts with the common assumption of a phenotypic trade-off between decreased larval period and increase d mass at metamorphosis.

ABSTRACT: Of the various hypotheses proposed to be the cause of abnormalities in amphibians, four (parasites, toxins, predation and UV-B) have been supported with reasonable evidence.
Recent research into deformity-inducing parasites has focused primarily on trematodes.
Apart from trematodes, other forms of parasites have been known to use amphibians as hosts for the completion of their life-cycle.
These include parasitic copepods of the genera Argulus and Lernaea.
However, there have been no accounts of abnormalities arising from parasitic infestations by such copepods.
In January, 2001, a batch of tadpoles belonging to the copper-cheeked frog Rana chalconota (Schlegel) was collected from a disused fish pond in Sukabumi, West Java, Indonesia.
This is a common species, which occurs from lowland to above 1200 m and has a preference for stagnant waters such as fish ponds.
From this batch, a total of 214 tadpoles were counted (Gosner Stages 26-42, total lengths 15.1-49.2mm).
Among them, 144 tadpoles (67.3%) were found to have at least one to as many as 15 individual copepods (Lernaea cyprinacea) attached to their bodies and/or tails.
Of the tadpoles with the externally visible copepods, eight tadpoles were observed to exhibit various types of limb abnormalities.
Brachymely was recorded for three tadpoles (Stages 36-39), which had relatively shorter right hind limbs.
Polymely was recorded for four tadpoles (Stages 36-41), two of which further exhibited polydactyly, and another further exhibited brachymely.
The eighth tadpole (Stage 42) exhibited ectromely, whereby the entire right hind limb was missing, with no signs of scar tissue.
Although the incidence of abnormal tadpoles was low (0.06% of infected tadpoles), this is possibly the first time in which amphibian abnormalities are associated with parasitic copepods.
While Lernaea has been found to parasitise fish, such as Poecilia
reticulata, its affiliation with tadpoles has not been documented
in Java.
Observations of the most common points of attachment on the tadpole host by the copepod parasite agree closely with studi es by Martins 
These two main 'hot-spots' are around the mouth and vent.
It is the parasites around the vent, which are most likely to have caused malformations in limb development,
as the site of anchorage (whereby the embedded head of the copepo d is fastened sub-dermally) may be the region of limb-bud developme nt. Further study into this probable cause needs to be carried out to
better ascertain the role of the copepod parasite in limb malformations.

ABSTRACT: The most remarkable of all the effects of retinoids on embryonic systems is the homeotic transformation of tails into legs which was recently reported using an Indian species of frog.
Since then several attempts have been made to repeat these results on other species, notably Xenopus, with no success.
Here I report the successful repetition of this homeotic transformation using Rana temporaria tadpoles treated with retinyl palmitate.
The phenomenon is concentration- dependent, time-dependent, and stage-dependent.
There is some difference in effect according to the tail amputation level.
The limbs induced are always hindlimbs
and there can be between 1 and 9 of them.
There is a tendency to induce limbs in pairs so that even numbered groups are produced in considerable excess over odd numbered groups.
As assessed by cartilage staining the majority of the limbs are normal in the proximodistal and anteroposterior axes.
The other types of outgrowths induced are double-posterior limbs, posterior half- limbs (usually defective in the proximodistal axis), and spikes.
As assessed by the anatomy of the muscle- patterns some of these apparently normal limbs are duplicated in the dorsoventral axis.
The stage and species dependencies of this phenomenon suggest that it may involve thyroid hormone receptors whose levels rise leading up to metamorphosis and whose interactions with retinoic acid receptors have recently been described.

ABSTRACT: (Editorial) Kermit the frog is in trouble.
Mortality rates and the incidence of developmental abnormalities in feral frog populations have increased sharply over the past 10 years.
Many studies during the 1990's have focused on hindlimb abnormalities because the developing hind-limb buds of frogs are particularly accessible to para-sites and environmental toxins.
The "normal" fre-quency of hindlimb abnormalities is 2-3%, at least a part of which may be due to heritable background genetic mutations.
However, deformities significantly above background levels have been reported in many states and three Canadian provinces, suggesting that certain natural and/or anthropogenic agents are de-grading the environment, and prompting concerns for human health.
Hence, frogs have taken center stage as potential barometers of environmental and ecological change.

ABSTRACT: There are a number of populations of amphibians, especially frogs, in which individuals with supernumerary legs, digits, or both occur at relatively high frequencies.
The cause or causes of this phenomenon are uncertain despite several investigations.
The existence of such populations with largely inadaptive structures suggests that occasionally higher taxa may originate from similar populations.
A theory is given that explains how such a process could occur, resulting in a morphologically and adaptively discontinuous origin for the new taxon.
If this process ever has occurred instances of it must be rare and probably can never be identified in the fossil record.

ABSTRACT: The occasional occurrence of high frequencies of limb abnormalities, including extra limbs, in natural populations of amphibians has long been a puzzle.
In this paper we report the discovery of a population in which such limb abnormalities appear to be caused by a parasitic flatworm (trematode) that uses amphibians as intermediate hosts.
The cerearial larval stage of the trematode attacks amphibians, penetrating the skin to form cysts (metacercariae).
The cysts are preferentially localized in the cloacal region, including the developing hind limb regions in larvae of both frogs (Hyla regilla) and salamanders (Ambystoma macrodactylum).
A wide range of limb abnormalities are seen, including duplicated limb structures ranging from extra digits to several extra whole limbs.
We hypothesize that these limb abnormalities result from localized regulatory responses of developing and regenerating limb tissues to mechanical disruption caused by the treatode cysts.
We have tested this idea by implanting inert resin beads into developing limb buds of frogs and salamanders.
Since this treatment can cause supernumerary limb structures, our hypothesis is sufficient to explain the naturally occurring extra limbs.

ABSTRACT: We report that methoprene and its derivatives can stimulate gene transcription in vertebrates by acting through the retinoic acid-responsive transcription factors, the retinoid X receptors (RXRs).
Methoprene is an insect growth regulator in domestic and agricultural use as a pesticide.
At least one metabolite of methoprene, methoprene acid, directly binds to RXR and is a transcriptional activator in both insect and mammalian cells.
Unlike the endogenous RXR ligand, 9-cis- retinoic acid, this activity is RXR-specific; the methoprene derivatives do not activate the retinoic acid receptor pathway.
Methoprene is a juvenile hormone analog that acts to retain juvenile characteristics during insect growth, preventing metamorphosis into an adult, and it has been shown to have ovicidal properties in some insects.
Thus, a pesticide that mimics the action of juvenile hormone in insects can also activate a mammalian retinoid-responsive pathway.
This finding provides a basis through which the potential bioactivity of substances exposed to the environment may be reexamined and points the way for discovery of new receptor ligands in both insects and vertebrates.

ABSTRACT: Frogs with malformed or missing legs have been discovered at more than 170 locations in the US including Minnesota, Wisconsin, Ohio , Quebec, and Ontario, giving rise to a most perplexing ecological issue.
No agreement has yet been reached among researchers as regards the cause of these deformities, although many investigators attribute them to chemical pollutants, increased UV radiation from ozone depletion, parasitic infestations, or some combination of the three.
The retinoic acid (RA) pathway is the most studied of all chemical mechanisms that could have caused th e deformation.
Supporters of the parasitic hypothesis put the blame on trematodes, a class of parasitic flatworms living in aquatic habitats.

ABSTRACT:
Two specimens of the (Rana sphenocephala utricularius) from Tennessee in Austin Peay State University's Museum of Zoology exhibit noteworthy morphological malformations.
A six-legged specimen from Montgomery County has an extra set of hind limbs and what appears to be an extra pelvic girdle.
A three-legged individual from Stewart County is missing its right hind limb.
Prior to this report, only two cases of malformed amphibians in Tennessee were known.
Based on the ratio of normal to abnormal specimens observed in the region and the nature of the malformations involved, the specimens described in this paper are considered the result of infrequent and spontaneous breakdowns in the normal developmental process, not evidence of some pervasive environmental problem facing amphibians in the region.

ABSTRACT: The occurrence of supernumerary extremities in anurans is discussed.
The extra forelimb of a 7.3 cm male Rana temporaria is studied in detail using x-ray, histological and electron microscopical techniques.
The extra limb was found not to participate in locomotion or to react to mechanical and chemical stimuli, but it possessed a well-developed nuptial thumb pad and pathologically inconspicuous muscular and neuronal tissues.
Stained section revealed sarcomere lengths of around 1.8um as well as muscle regions in which the fibers were in a state of contraction.
Although the latter finding proves that the muscles in the extra limb had the ability to contract, the stimulus for this contraction is obscure (i.e. mechanical injury during dissection; "cold-shortening" by the 4-5 degree C prefixative solution; abnormal neuronal function and wiring).
A thin layer of cartliage associated with the joints in the extra leg indicative of little 'wear', suggests non-use, just like some minor ultrastructural modifications of the Schwann cell cytoplasm.
On the whole, the main abnormalities of the extra leg concern state of development and morphometrics of limb and shoulder girdle bones.
The largest deviations from the normal condition were put froward: it could have originated through regeneration of a budding limb injured early in the tadpole's life, on the other hand, there is good experimental evidence that extra leggedness in anurans is caused by exposure of gametes to radioactive substances in and around breeding ponds that over many years are known to have produced abnormal anurans.

ABSTRACT: Two independent research teams in California have shown that frogs exposed to parasitic worms known as trematodes can develop limb deformities like those seen increasingly in frogs in the wild.
Researchers in Minnesota say, however, that there is no sign of such parasites in the deformed frogs there.
