1.
Books dealing with a North Carolina subject (regardless of author, publisher, or language) or by a North Carolinian (regardless of subject, publisher, or language) published during the period of July 1, 1998 through June 30, 1999.
One of two circumstances usually accounts for the inclusion of a title published prior to that period or the omission of a title published during that period: a delay in acquisition by the North Carolina Collection or the indefiniteness of the publishers release date.
In addition, some books privately printed or issued by little-known peripatetic presses may not have come to the notice of the collection.
With rare exceptions, serials, government documents, and publications not intended for public distribution or widespread audience are excluded, as are maps, broadsides, and nonbook material.
With the exception of poetry, in which pamphlets are sometimes included, most of the entries represent books, though there is no arbitrary limit to the number of pages constituting a "book."
New printings by an original publisher with no alteration of content are usually omitted, unless the book has been out of print for a significant time.
In the interest of simplicity and space, entries have sometimes been shortened, but full citations may be determined by consulting the collections online catalog.
Because the North Carolina Collection seeks to preserve copies of all significant North Caroliniana, the compiler welcomes information on omitted items.
