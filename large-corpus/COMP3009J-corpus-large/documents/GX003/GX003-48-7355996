Summary of Evidence
Note: Separate PDQ summaries on Screening for Esophageal Cancer and Esophageal Cancer Treatment are also available.
Squamous cell carcinoma
Tobacco and Alcohol Use
Squamous cell cancer of the esophagus is strongly and independently associated with tobacco and alcohol abuse.[1]
Levels of Evidence
3aii: Evidence obtained from well-designed and conducted cohort or case-control studies, preferably from more than one center or research group that have a cancer incidence endpoint.
4: Ecologic and descriptive studies (e.g., international patterns studies, migration studies, time series).
The relative risk associated with tobacco use is 2.4, and the population attributable risk is 54.2% (95% confidence interval (CI), 3.0-76.2).[1] Retrospective cohort studies adjusted for tobacco use have shown a 2-fold to 7-fold increase in risk of esophageal cancer in alcoholics, compared with rates for the general population.[2]
Level of Evidence
3: Evidence obtained from well-designed and conducted cohort or case-control studies, preferably from more than one center or research group.
Dietary Factors
Diets high in vegetables and fruits are associated with a decreased risk of esophageal cancer.[1]
Level of Evidence
3: Evidence obtained from well-designed and conducted cohort or case-control studies, preferably from more than one center or research group.
High intake of vitamin C and high intake of carotenoids possibly decrease the risk of esophageal cancer.[1]
Level of Evidence
3: Evidence obtained from well-designed and conducted cohort or case-control studies, preferably from more than one center or research group.
Drinking Mate (a hot beverage common in South America)
A significant dose-response relationship has been reported in South America between the amount of mate (a hot, aromatic beverage with stimulant properties like tea or coffee) drunk each day and the risk of esophageal cancer, with an odds ratio (OR) ranging between 1.5 and 12.2.[3] The very high temperature at which this beverage is consumed appears to be important.
Level of Evidence
3: Evidence obtained from well-designed and conducted cohort or case-control studies, preferably from more than one center or research group.
Aspirin and Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drug Use
Epidemiologic studies have found that aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use is associated with decreased risk of developing or dying from esophageal cancer (OR = 0.57, 95% CI = 0.47-0.71).
[4] Levels of Evidence 3ai, 3aii: Evidence obtained from well-designed and conducted cohort or case-control studies, preferably from more than one cancer or research group, that have cancer mortality and cancer incidence endpoints.
4ai, 4aii: Ecologic and descriptive studies (e.g., international patterns studies, migration studies, time series) that have cancer mortality and cancer incidence endpoints.
Adenocarcinoma of the esophagus
Gastroesophageal Reflux/BarrettÃ¯Â¿Â½s Esophagus
A strong association exists between gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and adenocarcinoma.[5] Long-standing GERD is associated with the development of BarrettÃ¯Â¿Â½s esophagus, a condition in which an abnormal intestinal type epithelium replaces the stratified squamous epithelium that normally lines the distal esophagus.
It is unknown whether elimination of gastroesophageal reflux by surgical or medical means will reduce the risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma.[6]
Level of Evidence
4: Ecologic and descriptive studies (e.g., international patterns studies, migration studies, time series).
Aspirin and Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drug Use
Epidemiologic studies have found that aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use is associated with decreased risk of developing or dying from esophageal cancer
(OR = 0.57, 95% CI = 0.47-0.71).[4] Levels of Evidence 3ai, 3aii: Evidence obtained from well-designed and conducted cohort or case-control studies, preferably from more than one cancer or research group, that have cancer mortality and cancer incidence endpoints.

Significance
Incidence and Mortality
Annually, approximately 13,900 Americans will be diagnosed with esophageal cancer, and 13,000 will die of this malignancy.
Of the new cases, 10,600 will occur in men and 3,300 will occur in women.[1]
Two histological types account for the majority of malignant esophageal neoplasms, i.e., adenocarcinoma and squamous carcinoma.
The epidemiology of these types varies markedly.
In the 1960s, squamous cell cancers comprised over 90% of all esophageal tumors.
The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinomas has risen markedly over the past 2 decades, such that it is now more prevalent than squamous cell cancer in the United States and Western Europe, with most tumors located in the distal esophagus.[2] Although the overall incidence of squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus is declining, this histologic type remains 6 times more likely to occur in black males than in white males.[3]
In black men, however, the incidence rate for the 55 to 69 year age group is close to that of whites in the 70 and over age group.
In black women, aged 55 to 69 years, the incidence rate is slightly higher than that of white women in the 70 years and older age group.
Risk Factors
While risk factors for squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus have been identified (such as tobacco use, alcoholism, malnutrition, infection with human papillomavirus),[4] the risk factors associated with esophageal adenocarcinoma are less well defined.
The most important epidemiological difference between squamous cell cancer and adenocarcinoma, however, is the strong association between gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and adenocarcinoma.
The results of a population-based case controlled study suggest that symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux is a risk factor for esophageal adenocarcinoma.
The frequency, severity, and duration of reflux symptoms were positively associated with increased risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma.[5]
An interesting hypothesis relates the rise in the incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma to a declining prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection in Western countries.
Reports have suggested that gastric infection with H. pylori may protect the esophagus from GERD and its complications.[6] According to this theory, H. pylori infections that cause pangastritis also cause a decrease in gastric acid production that protects against GERD.[7]
GERD is a risk factor for esophageal adenocarcinoma because long-standing GERD is associated with BarrettÃ¯Â¿Â½s esophagus, the condition in which an abnormal intestinal epithelium replaces the stratified squamous epithelium that normally lines the distal esophagus.[11] The intestinal-type epithelium of BarrettÃ¯Â¿Â½s esophagus has a characteristic endoscopic appearance that differs from squamous epithe

Evidence of Benefit
Tobacco, Alcohol, and Dietary Factors
In the United States, squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus is strongly associated with tobacco and alcohol abuse.
The risk declines with smoking cessation.
In China, esophageal cancer is associated with deficiencies of nutrients such as retinol, riboflavin, alpha- and beta-carotene, alpha-tocopherol, ascorbate, and zinc, and with exposure to specific carcinogens (e.g., N-nitroso compounds).[1]
Chemoprevention
A prospective, placebo-controlled, esophagus chemoprevention study randomized 610 high-risk Chinese subjects.[2] Subjects were from 35 to 64 years old and received either placebo or combined low-dose retinol (15 mg or 50,000 IU) plus riboflavin (200 mg) and zinc gluconate (50 mg) for 13.5 months.
Standard histological evaluations (including 2 endoscopic biopsies) were made of 93% of all entered subjects.
Micronuclei from esophageal cells were obtained before therapy began and after the 13.5 months of treatment.
Serum levels of vitamin A, beta-carotene, riboflavin, and zinc were obtained at 0, 2, and 13.5 months.
The second report of this study presented micronuclei frequency results.[3] A statistically significant reduction occurred in the mean percentage of micronucleated esophageal cells in the active-treatment group compared to the placebo group.
The pattern of cell proliferation, another potential intermediate endpoint marker, also improved.[4]
Two NCI-sponsored phase III trials of combinations of multiple vitamins and minerals have been reported.
Both were conducted in a high-risk area of China (Linxian).
In one, a complex modified factorial design was used to study 4 different vitamin/mineral combinations administered for 5 years at doses 1 to 2 times the U.S. RDA to 29,584 subjects.[5] The combination of beta-carotene, alpha-tocopherol, and selenium was associated with a nonstatistically significant 4% reduction in the esophageal cancer mortality rate.
The other trial included only higher-risk subjects with esophageal dysplasia [6] and had a 2-arm design (26 vitamins and minerals, including beta-carotene, alpha-tocopherol, and selenium, at 2 to 3 times the U.S. recommended daily allowances (RDA) in one arm versus placebo in the other).
This 6-year intervention was associated with a nonsignificant change: a 16% reduction in the esophageal cancer mortality rate.
Similar studies have not been conducted in the United States.
Aspirin and Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs
A systematic review and meta-analysis of the association of aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with esophageal cancer identified 2 cohort and 7 case-control studies published between 1980 and 2001.[7] Pooled results show a protective association between aspirin/NSAID use and esophageal cancer (odds ratio (OR) = 0.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.47-0.71).
Association with aspirin use was statistically significant (OR = 0.50, 95% CI = 0.38-0.66); association with NSAIDs was of borderline significance (OR = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.54-1.0).
Aspirin/NSAID use was associated with lower risk of both adenocarcinoma (OR = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.51-0.87) and squamous cell carcinoma (OR = 0.58, 95% CI = 0.43-0.78).
